Many of their specialties contain demonic beasts\u2019 meat, which will greatly help your cultivation!\u201d", "\u201cOkay! It\u2019s all up to you, Brother Su Mo!\u201d", "Xi\u2019er nodded and felt greatly moved by Su Mo\u2019s kindness. Over the past few days, she had gotten to know his character.", "He was gentle, easygoing, generous, and sincere.", "She was overjoyed that she had made the right decision to follow him.", "Rongxuan Restaurant was the best one in Sunnywood City.", "The interior decoration of the five-story building was extremely luxurious. This bustling restaurant was where many wealthy martial artists ate and entertained guests.", "Su Mo walked up to the door, holding Gu Lanxi\u2019s hand.", "\u201cBrother Su Mo, it must be expensive to eat here!\u201d", "Xi\u2019er could not help but comment at the sight of this luxurious restaurant. Born into a poor family, she naturally felt a little timid about such an upscale place.", "\u201cHaha! Xi\u2019er, we\u2019re tycoons now. Money isn\u2019t a thing!\u201d said Su Mo with a smile.", "The girl grew silent as she remembered witnessing Su Mo spend more than 500kg of gold in the blink of an eye.", "They immediately caught many people\u2019s attention as soon as they entered, but most of the attention was focused on the girl.", "Their eyes were full of infatuation.", "They were jealous of Su Mo and thought,\u00a0\u201cHow did the loser young master of the Sus manage to win such a beauty?\u201d", "\u201cSu Mo, over here!\u201d", "Suddenly, a voice called to him from the lobby of the restaurant.", "\u201cHmm?\u201d", "Su Mo turned around and found that Su Heng had actually called to him.", "Su Heng and another teenager were sitting near the window.", "The handsome young man was donned in fine clothes and was gazing at them intently.", "To be exact, he was gazing at Xi\u2019er.", "Su Mo frowned at them. He knew that the young man in fine clothes was the son of the Sunnywood City Governor\u2014Lin Xiao.", "\u201cWhy are they eating together?\u201d", "However, since Su Heng buried the hatchet and invited him, Su Mo would not put on airs, either.", "Su Mo walked over while holding her hand.", "Seeing them hold hands, Lin Xiao\u2019s eyes glinted with an undetectable trace of bleakness.", "\u201cShould we sit here?\u201d asked Su Mo when standing in front of them.", "However, Su Heng did not respond to Su Mo, and Lin Xiao did not even glance at him.", "Lin Xiao stood up, smiled gently at Xi\u2019er, and said, \u201cHi, my name\u2019s Lin Xiao, son of the city governor. Please have a seat!\u201d", "Having glanced at him, Xi\u2019er turned to look at Su Mo.", "If Su Mo did not answer, she would not accept anyone else\u2019s invitation.", "Su Mo sneered at Lin Xiao\u2019s hidden intention, but he still said, \u201cXi\u2019er, let\u2019s sit here!\u201d", "He then pulled a chair over to sit down.", "\u201cYou don\u2019t deserve to sit here, you loser.\u201d", "Lin Xiao suddenly barked at Su Mo with a darkened expression.", "\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Su Mo squinted and asked coldly.", "\u201cDidn\u2019t I make myself clear? You, a piece of trash with a Rank 1 Human Class Martial Soul, don\u2019t deserve to sit with me!\u201d", "Lin Xiao glared at Su Mo, thinking,\u00a0\u201cThis guy really has no self-awareness!\u201d", "Subsequently, he smiled gently at Xi\u2019er and said, \u201cPlease do me the honor of sitting with me and drinking the most delicious wine in Rongxuan Pavilion.\u201d", "With a sincere expression, Lin Xiao invited Xi\u2019er once again.", "Her\u2019s eyes revealed a hint of disgust, and she refused to sit down. She became annoyed by their humiliation of Su Mo.", "\u201cYou two are jerking me around?\u201d Su Mo asked indifferently without becoming enraged.", "\u201cYes, we are! So what?\u201d", "With his face full of disdain, Su Heng proudly said, \u201cSu Mo, if you know what\u2019s good for you, you\u2019d better give this beauty to the son of the city governor, or you\u2019ll be in deep water.\u201d", "\u201cSu Heng, as a disciple of the Sus, how dare you to kiss up to him?\u201d", "Su Mo smiled mockingly and said, \u201cWas my last lesson to you not enough? Are you itching for another beating?\u201d", "\u201cYou\u2026!\u201d", "Su Heng was furious. It took him two entire weeks to fully recover from the injuries Su Mo inflicted.", "Su Mo\u2019s words had uncovered this bad memory. If he were not wary of Su Mo\u2019s strength, he would have struck him at once.", "\u201cSu Mo, right? I won\u2019t say it again. She stays, but you get out!\u201d Lin Xiao stopped smiling and ruthlessly snapped.", "\u201cGet out?\u201d\u00a0", "Su Mo raised his eyebrows, coldly smiled, and gently flicked his extended hand.", "Crack!", "A crisp and loud slap echoed in the restaurant.", "Suddenly, a clear palm print appeared on Lin Xiao\u2019s face.", "The scene silenced the crowd around and shocked them. They obviously had not expected that the useless young master of the Sus would actually slap the son of the city governor on his cheek!", "\u201cThis guy is done for. Even if he isn\u2019t killed, he\u2019ll at least lose a layer of skin!\u201d", "Everyone was watching the incident with great interest and taking guesses at what would happen.", "No one was happier than Su Heng who could now watch Su Mo be taught a lesson by the son of the city governor.", "\u201cHaha!\u00a0Su Mo\u00a0, you\u2019re exceptionally stupid!\u201d", "\u201cThe son of the city governor is at Lv 5 Qi cultivation Realm, and you should never provoke him. You\u2019ll meet a miserable end today!\u201d", "Su Heng wildly laughed in his mind.", "The slap was even more unexpected for Lin Xiao, who was now frozen in shock.", "He soon snapped out of it. Feeling the stinging mark on his cheek, he scanned the eyes of all the people watching him.", "The raging and boiling anger in his mind was all-consuming.", "As the son of the city governor, he had been widely adored for all his life.", "No one in Sunnywood City dared to hit him. Even his father, the city governor, did not beat him at all.", "However, he had been slapped by a loser in public.", "\u201cYou\u2026 slapped me?\u201d", "His deep voice sounded like a beast\u2019s roar in the back of his throat, and his eyes flashed like those of poisonous snakes.", "\u201cAre you a retard or a stupid fu*ker? Don\u2019t you know whether you\u2019ve been slapped?\u201d", "Su Mo acted in a nonchalant fashion as if he had done nothing.", "Everyone fell silent and looked at Su Mo with sympathy.", "\u201cIs he a fool?\u201d", "\u201cHis Martial Soul is trash, and so is his mind!\u201d"]}}
