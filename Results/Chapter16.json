Let\u2019s see if he still has the guts to brag in front of us.\u201d", "The bandits could not help but mock him when they heard the screams coming from the bushes.", "However, their expressions soon changed.", "After a long time, the scar-faced bandit still had not emerged.", "The bushes were completely silent.", "\u201cWhat happened? Why hasn\u2019t he come out yet?\u201d", "All the bandits were confused.", "\u201cMa the Third\u2026\u201d", "The bandits began yelling his nickname, but there was no reply from the bushes.", "\u201cYou two, go take a look,\u201d ordered the leader of the bandits to two men next to him.", "The two looked at each other and walked into the bushes.", "However, they did not make a single sound after entering the bushes, as if they had completely disappeared, just like the scar-faced bandit.", "All the bandits finally could not sit still any longer and stood up with grave expressions.", "\u201cDamn it, what happened?\u201d", "\u201cFu*k! What the hell!\u201d", "\u201cHumph! I want to know who has the guts to mess with the Bloody Blade Stockade!\u201d", "The leader of the bandits yelled with a grave expression, \u201cYou two, stay here to watch over these women. The rest come check it out with me!\u201d", "Clang! Clang! Clang!", "They unsheathed their steel sabers and approached the bushes in a fan shape.", "\u201cHuff\u2026 Huff\u2026\u201d", "Many of them were panting and alert, prepared for any potential danger.", "Soon after they stepped into the bushes, they saw three mangled corpses in the grass.", "It was the scar-faced bandit and the two bandits who had come to check on him.", "The three bodies did not even look like human anymore. They were completely emaciated and drained of their blood and Qi, as if they had been mummified.", "If not for their clothes, the bandits would not be able to tell that the corpses were their companions.", "\u201cHiss!\u201d", "\u201cHiss! Hiss!\u201d", "Although these bandits were cruel murderers who were numb to death, they all hissed in shock.", "\u201cIs this\u2026. the work of a vampire?\u201d one of the bandits asked.", "However, there was no one in sight.", "\u201cNo, they were killed by a human. Look at their necks.\u201d", "An astute bandit noticed that there was a thin slice on each of the three corpses\u2019 necks.", "Killed in one sword stroke!", "This was the same for all three men.", "\u201cAh! Ah\u2026!\u201d", "Suddenly, something strange happened again.", "Two screams came from behind them.", "The terrified screams of the women followed.", "\u201cDamn it\u2026!\u201d", "All the bandits retreated in shock.", "The bandits saw that the two men they had left behind were lying on the ground.", "Next to the two men stood a young man. He was around 15 years old, held a bloody sword, and was looking at them coldly.", "When the women saw this man run out and swiftly kill two people, they began screaming in terror.", "\u201cDon\u2019t be afraid. I won\u2019t hurt you!\u201d said the young man to the women.", "That young man was Su Mo.", "He had followed the scar-faced bandit and saw him trying to do unspeakable things to a woman, so he entered the bushes, killed the scar-faced bandit, and saved the young woman.", "Then, he killed the other two bandits.", "Afterwards, he also devoured all of their blood and Qi.", "All three bandits were at Lv 3 Qi Cultivation Realm, and after Su Mo devoured their blood and Qi, he immediately reached the Peak Lv 3 Qi Cultivation Realm.", "Then, when the bandits came to inspect the situation, he circled back around and killed the two guards.", "Thus, Su Mo effortlessly killed five men in a row.", "\u201cWho are you? How dare you challenge the Bloody Blade Stockade?\u201d asked the leader, who sized up Su Mo coldly.", "\u201cI\u2019m the one to kill all of you!\u201d", "Su Mo\u2019s eyes were cold, and he exuded a fierce murderous aura.", "\u201cHumph! Peak of Lv 3 Qi Cultivation Realm, and you want to kill us all?\u201d", "The bandit leader sensed Su Mo\u2019s cultivation and chuckled. He waved at his subordinates, and they immediately surrounded Su Mo.", "The leader was at Lv 5 Qi Cultivation Realm and very powerful. Three or four of his men were at Lv 4, and the others were at Lv 3.", "With all their strength, he naturally was not afraid of a scrawny Lv 3 kid.", "However, he still did not let his guard down, since this kid had somehow mummified all the bodies that he killed.", "Also, this kid must be considerably powerful since he had managed to kill all those men without a sound.", "\u201cYou\u2019ll see.\u201d", "Su Mo grinned. The benefits from devouring all the blood Qi had begun to boil his blood.", "\u201cKill him!\u201d", "The bandit leader ordered his men with a wave, while he stood still and watch.", "\u201cKill!\u201d", "\u201cKill! Kill!\u201d", "Four bandits roared, and rushed toward Su Mo and cut with their glinting steel sabers at him.", "The bandit leader chuckled. He believed that this attack would instantly kill the kid.", "All four attacking bandits were at Lv 3 Qi Cultivation Realm. Together, they would overpower even a Lv 4 martial artist.", "Su Mo scoffed at their attack and said, \u201cGo to hell!\u201d", "\u201cWhoosh!\u201d", "Su Mo used Shadow Steps to dodge their attack.", "\u201cWhoosh!\u201d", "A dazzling sword radiance appeared, and Sword Qi shot out everywhere.", "\u201cAh! Ah\u2026!\u201d", "With a series of cries, all four bandits immediately collapsed and died.", "Killed with one stroke!", "\u201cWhat\u2026\u201d", "All the other bandits stared in disbelief.", "They could not understand how this kid at Lv 3 Qi cultivation could be so powerful.", "\u201cKill! Everyone! There\u2019s no way a low-level kid can kill us all!\u201d", "The bandit leader roared with a livid face and led the rush forward.", "He carried a giant billhook, which he forcefully brought down upon Su Mo.", "This billhook weighed at least 100 kg. Combined with the leader\u2019s cultivation of Level Five, one hack was enough to split even metal into two.", "Whoosh!", "Su Mo did not dodge his attack but instead met it with his sword.", "Gale Blade!", "Su Mo channeled all of his genuine Qi and his physical strength to carry out the first move of Divine Wind Swordplay, Gale Blade.", "Clang!", "The billhook and sword violently crashed into each other and gave off a thunderous noise.", "Su Mo\u2019s entire body shook, and he and the bandit leader both staggered back three steps.", "Both men were equal in this attack!", "Although the bandit leader was at Lv 5 Qi Cultivation Realm, which was two whole realms higher than Su Mo\u2019s, his cultivation skill and martial arts techniques were only Medium Lv 1.", "Su Mo was only at Lv 3 Qi Cultivation Realm, but his Primordial Original Qi was incredibly strong and made his true ability equal that of Lv 4.", "Also considering his physical strength, he could easily contend with Lv 4 martial artists.", "He also had cultivated a Lower Lv 3 Martial Skill, the Divine Wind Swordplay.", "If he had begun cultivating this skill earlier, he would have been able to defeat the bandit leader with that stroke.", "\u201cHow is this possible?\u201d the bandit leader roared in shock.", "\u201cHow can you be so powerful at only Peak Lv 3 Qi Cultivation Realm?\u201d"]}}
