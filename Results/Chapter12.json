Su Mo, you\u2019d better go to the meeting hall at once.\u201d", "Su Tai smirked with a hint of gloating in his eyes.", "\u201cThe meeting hall? What for?\u201d", "Su Mo felt confused.", "Su Tai impatiently scolded, \u201cStop with all the questions! You\u2019ll know when you get there.\u201d", "\u201cHumph!\u201d Su Mo grunted and walked toward the meeting hall.", "\u201cLoser, you shouldn\u2019t be so arrogant. I can\u2019t wait to see you be punished today.\u201d", "Su Tai sneered and followed closely behind.", "In the meeting hall\u2014", "Su Hong sat in dignity in the seat of honor.", "Beneath him, several elders and junior disciples of the Sus were sitting to his left.", "On the right were two middle-aged men and three young men of the Weis, all of them fuming with an accusatory look.", "\u201cWhy hasn\u2019t Su Mo arrived yet?\u201d", "A middle-aged man of the Weis wearing a brocade robe asked sullenly.", "\u201cHaha!

How will you punish him?\u201d Another middle-aged man asked.", "He was Wei Wankong, the Master of the Weis.", "\u201cAh\u2026\u201d", "The present elders of the Sus remained speechless. They all wanted to say that the Weis could punish Su Mo however they liked, but they did not dare to speak before Su Hong.", "Nobody wanted to talk first and infuriate Su Hong.", "\u201cSu Hong, your son hurt my son and destroyed my son\u2019s cultivation. If you don\u2019t do something about it, the Weis will never forget this,\u201d said Wei Wankong, who coldly scanned the room and fixed his eyes on Su Hong.", "\u201cSince Su Mo had evil intentions and hurt your son, we should let you punish him at will.\u201d", "The First Elder replied before Su Hong could.", "His eyes were full of gloating.", "\u201cHow dare you?\u201d", "Su Hong abruptly shouted and looked at him. \u201cFirst Elder, are you the Master? Can you make decisions for the Sus?\u201d", "\u201cYou\u2026!\u201d", "The First Elder was furious but could not refute him, and his expression suddenly became stony.", "\u201cMaster Wei, we don\u2019t clearly know about the incident and can\u2019t make a decision until my son is here,\u201d Su Hong said to Wei Wankong.", "\u201cHumph!

While the Sus and Weis were regarded as the two largest clans, the latter was more powerful than the former.", "The Weis had ruled over Sunnywood City for over 200 years, so they had a profound background.", "However, the Sus only rose into prominence in the past few decades, so their background was less profound than the Weis\u2019.", "The Weis sneered at the desperate Su elders, their faces full of contempt.", "Everyone waited in silence.", "The atmosphere in the hall was very grim.", "After a while, footsteps sounded outside of the door.", "Su Mo and the Fourth Elder entered the hall.", "\u201cSu Mo, do you confess your crime?\u201d", "The First Elder suddenly yelled as soon as Su Mo entered the hall.", "\u201cConfess my crime?\u201d With a glint in his eyes, Su Mo asked, \u201cFirst Elder, what have I done wrong? Why should I confess?\u201d", "\u201cYou maliciously mutilated the second son of Master Wei. You\u2019re the scum of our clan and have embarrassed us greatly.

Now that the First Elder had taken the lead, they did not hold back.", "Now, all the elders of the Sus were on the First Elder\u2019s side.", "The first elder not only was as powerful as Su Hong, but also, more importantly, he had a genius son.", "Su Yu had a Rank 5 Human Class Martial Soul, and as the first genius of the Sus, he would rule the clan someday.", "All of the Weis only watched silently.", "\u201cMaliciously? Scum?\u201d", "Su Mo laughed and indifferently asked, \u201cElders, as soon as I entered the hall, you said I\u2019m malicious, called me a scum, and want my confession. How are you so sure that I\u2019m guilty since you know nothing?\u201d", "Glancing at the Wei clan, Su Mo realized that the Weis came here!", "\u201cHow dare you to quibble?\u201d The First Elder yelled, and his looked extremely gloomy.", "Su Mo\u2019s eyes grew cold. He sneered and said, \u201cFirst Elder, you asked me to confess before hearing my explanation. Am I guilty just because you say I am? Is everything I said quibbling? Are you an elder of the Sus or the Weis?\u201d", "\u201cYou\u2026!\u201d", "The First Elder was incensed. He did not expect Su Mo to be so sharp-witted.", "\u201cIt\u2019s enough, Mo\u2019er. Tell us about it in detail.\u201d", "Su Hong said as he glared at the First Elder with narrowed and piercing eyes.", "\u201cAlright!\u201d", "Su Mo immediately gave them a specific description of what had happened.", "However, he did not mention Su Qingqing by name and only explained that Wei Lin wanted to abduct a girl.", "Su Qingqing was just a common inferior in the Sus, and he did not want to get her in trouble.", "\u201cHumph!\u201d", "As soon as Su Mo finished speaking, Wei Wankong burst out shouting, \u201cDouchebag, you hurt my son, and you deserve to die, period.\u201d", "\u201cThat\u2019s right. You\u2019re so mean! Death sentence!\u201d", "\u201cYou should have known that you would die for provoking the Weis.\u201d", "The Weis all started to yell one by one.", "\u201cWei Lin attempted to break my limbs and destroy my elixir field, so I was forced to maim him.\u201d", "Su Mo ignored the Weis and instead asked indifferently, \u201cElders, in your opinion, was it criminal of me to defend myself against someone who wanted to destroy me?\u201d", "\u201cOutside of the mansion, all disciples of our clan can only be bullied by others, and if we fight back, we\u2019ll be criminals. Am I right?\u201d", "His brilliant words made all the elders sullen and silent.", "\u201cMaster Wei, it\u2019s pretty clear that your son wanted to break my son\u2019s limbs and destroy his elixir field, so he had to defend himself. Your son brought the trouble to himself.\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s impossible!\u201d", "Wei Wankong shouted loudly with a cold expression. \u201cMy son\u2019s misfortune is all your son\u2019s fault. If you don\u2019t let me handle this little piece of sh*t, you\u2019ll face the wrath of the Weis!\u201d", "\u201cHumph! Destroying scumbag like your son is doing everyone a favor!\u201d Su Mo disdainfully responded.", "\u201cFu*ker, go to hell!\u201d", "Wei Wankong screamed angrily, suddenly stood up and flew toward Su Mo.", "A bleak aura of killing desire radiated from his body and enveloped the entire hall"]}}
