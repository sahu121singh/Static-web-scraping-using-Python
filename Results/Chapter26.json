{"Chapter 26": {" The Sky Yuan Sect": ["Translator:\u00a0Transn\u00a0\u00a0Editor:\u00a0Transn", "Just after sunrise, next to a crystal-clear pond behind the Sus mountain, sword radiance glittered as sword Qi sliced the air into a million pieces.", "Su Mo was practicing his swordplay. Ever since his fight with Wei Liang a month ago, he had gained a deeper understanding of Divine Wind Swordplay.", "Actual battles were the best way to practice.", "Lately, he had been coming here every morning to practice his swordplay.", "Divine Wind Swordplay had four movements. Two weeks ago, he had reached the Minor Completion Realm of the first three, and two days ago, he had reached the Minor Completion of the last one, boosting his strength tremendously.", "Su Mo did not neglect his cultivation over the course of the month, which had steadily increased to the Peak Lv 5 Qi Cultivation Realm.", "His Rank 6 Human Class Martial Soul cultivated extremely quickly, so he spent most of his time cultivating his physical body.", "His cultivation of Elephant\u2019s Strength Skill had reached the late stage of Lv 2, making his body as strong as six tigers and equivalent to a Lv 6 Qi Cultivation Realm martial artist.", "If he had fought Wei Liang with his current strength, Su Mo would have been able to instantly kill him with one move.", "Nearby, Xi\u2019er sat on a smooth boulder, resting her cheeks on her hands. She wore a snow-white dress with a blue jade pendant.", "\u201cXi\u2019er, do you want to learn this swordplay?\u201d asked Su Mo with a grin, having finished practicing.", "\u201cHaha! Brother Su Mo, I\u2019m very dumb. I don\u2019t know if I can learn such profound swordplay,\u201d Xi\u2019er said with a smile.", "\u201cWho said you\u2019re dumb? Xi\u2019er is smarter than everyone else.\u201d Su Mo smiled and then seriously said, \u201cXi\u2019er, you\u2019ve reached the Lv 8 of the Body Tempering Realm, right? Soon, when you complete it and awaken your Martial Soul, I\u2019ll teach you how to practice swordplay.\u201d", "The Body Tempering Realm toughened one\u2019s body, so it would be strong enough to awaken a Martial Soul.", "\u201cUh-huh!\u201d Xi\u2019er nodded.", "\u201cAlso, I always see you wearing this jade pendant and staring at it. Is there a story to it?\u201d Su Mo asked, sitting down next to her and looking at her pendant.", "\u201cOf course, you don\u2019t have to tell me if you don\u2019t want to. I\u2019m just asking.\u201d Su Mo hastily added when he saw her smile had disappeared.", "\u201cBrother Su Mo, this jade pendant is related to my birth story.\u201d", "She took off her jade pendant and gently said, \u201cWhen grandpa found me back then, I was still a baby. The only thing he found on me was this jade pendant. Perhaps, this jade pendant is the only thing related to my real identity.\u201d", "Su Mo took the jade pendant from her and studied it carefully.", "The sea-blue jade pendant was the size of a child\u2019s palm and had the word \u201cXuan\u201d carved on the back. This script was extremely elegant and gave off a powerful aura.", "Su Mo could tell that this was no ordinary pendant.", "\u201cXi\u2019er, if I ever get the chance, I\u2019ll definitely help you find your birth parents,\u201d Su Mo seriously said after handing her the pendant.", "\u201cThat\u2019s alright, Brother Su Mo. I\u2019m very happy with my life, and I feel lucky to be able to watch you practice swordplay every day.\u201d Xi\u2019er smiled.", "\u201cHaha! You silly girl!\u201d Su Mo gently rubbed her head.", "\u201cLet\u2019s go home, Xi\u2019er!\u201d Su Mo walked back to the Sus with her.", "\u2026", "After returning, Su Mo went to the Sus\u2019 martial practice field.", "The clan had an announcement to make today about the clan meeting.", "A lot of disciples already gathered in the martial practice field. Many of them greeted Su Mo when they saw him.", "\u201cHello, Cousin Su Mo!\u201d", "\u201cHello, Brother Su Mo!\u201d", "After Su Mo proved his strength to everyone in the fight last month, no one dared to call him a piece of trash anymore.", "Of course, a majority of them still wanted nothing to do with him.", "These people, including Su Heng and Su Yu, believed that Su Mo\u2019s powerful strength was temporary, and his accomplishments would nevertheless be limited due to his low-level Martial Soul.", "Su Yu was also on the martial practice field. He glanced at Su Mo as he approached from a distance but quickly looked away.", "Though the fight last month had shocked him, he still looked down on Su Mo.", "With a Rank 1 Human Class Martial Soul, Su Mo would never be able to catch up with him.", "A group had gathered around Su Yu, chattering about something excitedly.", "\u201cBrother Su Yu, I\u2019ve heard that Brother Tianhao and Su Hai have returned from the Sky Yuan Sect.\u201d", "\u201cYes! I\u2019ve heard both of them reached Lv 9 Qi Cultivation Realm. They\u2019re really terrifying!\u201d", "\u201cHaha! Brother Su Yu\u2019s Martial Soul is of a higher level than theirs. It won\u2019t be long before you enter the Sky Yuan Sect and surpass them.\u201d", "\u201cAre Su Tianhao and Su Hai back?\u201d", "Su Mo overheard their conversation from afar and raised his eyebrows.", "Su Tianhao and Su Hai were respectively the sons of the third and fourth elders. They were the strongest among the young Su disciples.", "Last year, they left the Sus at the age of 18 to join the Sky Yuan Sect, one of the four sects of Skymoon Country.", "No one expected they would reach Lv 9 Qi Cultivation Realm in just one year.", "Just then, the crowd stirred.", "\u201cHere comes Brother Tianhao and Brother Su Hai!\u201d", "Su Mo turned his head and saw two young men slowly walking over.", "Their aura was extremely powerful and greatly surpassed everyone else\u2019s.", "Su Tianhao was tall and slim, wearing a yellow robe and a stern expression.", "The other stocky man dressed completely in black was Su Hai.", "\u201cBrother Tianhao!\u201d", "\u201cBrother Su Hai!\u201d", "Just as the two reached the martial practice field, a group of young disciples crowded around them with adoring expressions.", "\u201cBrother Tianhao, Brother Su Hai, can you tell us what the Sky Yuan Sect is like?\u201d", "\u201cYes, yes! I\u2019ve heard that the Sky Yuan Sect is brimming with masters and geniuses. Is that true?\u201d", "\u201c\u2026\u201d", "The crowd fired one question after another about the Sky Yuan Sect.", "Su Tianhao looked prideful and showed no interest in answering their questions.", "On the contrary, Su Hai was full of smiles and answered. \u201cYou\u2019re right. The Sky Yuan Sect has 5,000 disciples, and each of them is a genius.\u201d", "That\u2019s not all. The sect has all kinds of powerful cultivation skills and martial arts techniques, as well as countless miraculous pills.", "Each month, we receive all kinds of resources, and our cultivation improves by strides.", "I\u2019m so valued in the sect that I\u2019ve heard some elders want me as their disciple!\u201d", "\u201c\u2026\u201d", "The more Su Hai blabbered on, the more excited and exaggerated he became, spewing spittle all over the place.", "However, all the surrounding disciples were mesmerized and envious. Even Su Yu was entranced by the stories.", "Su Mo\u2019s lip curled. Though he was not familiar with the Sky Yuan Sect, he knew that Su Hai was bragging.", "As one of the four sects in Skymoon Country, it made sense that every disciple was a genius there.", "However, Su Hai\u2019s Martial Soul was only at Lv 4, which probably placed him in the bottom tier of the sect. How could he receive so much attention and be selected as a disciple by elders?", "He was just talking crap!", "Su Hai loftily raised his head and smugly took in everyone\u2019s jealous stares.", "He greatly enjoyed the feeling of being envied.", "Just then, Su Hai noticed Su Mo\u2019s unimpressed expression out of the corner of his eye and instantly became enraged.", "\u201cHaha! Su Mo, I\u2019ve heard your strength is equivalent to Lv7 Qi Cultivation Realm, and you killed Wei Liang last month,\u201d he said with a smirk.", "Su Mo did not reply.", "Su Hai then abruptly changed his tone and scoffed. \u201cHowever, with your strength, you\u2019re nothing to me!", "I know you only have a Rank 1 Human Class Martial Soul. You\u2019ll never reach the Peak of the Qi Cultivation Realm, never mind entering the Sky Yuan Sect.\u201d", "Su Mo frowned. What was wrong with this guy? He had done nothing to deserve his ridicule!", "\u201cWhether or not I\u2019m capable of entering the Sky Yuan Sect is none of your business,\u201d he said flatly.", "\u201cHumph! You\u2019re just a powerless nobody!\u201d Su Hai coldly scoffed, and then he turned to Su Yu with a smile. \u201cSu Yu, I\u2019ve heard you have a Rank 5 Human Class Martial Soul. Not bad. At the end of this year, you can take the sect\u2019s entrance exam. It won\u2019t be a problem for you.", "Of course, all members with Rank 4 Human Class Martial Souls can take the exam, but that rank is the minimum requirement for entry, so it\u2019ll be hard to pass the exam. Back then, Brother Tianhao and I had exerted great effort to pass it.\u201d", "\u201cHaha! Next year, I\u2019ll definitely enter the Sky Yuan Sect.\u201d Su Yu smiled confidently and glanced at Su Mo with mocking eyes."]}}
