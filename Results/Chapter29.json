{"Chapter 29": {" I Will Protect You Forever": ["Translator:\u00a0Transn\u00a0\u00a0Editor:\u00a0Transn", "Su Mo quickly passed through the thick mountain forest with Xi\u2019er on his back.", "Those men in black kept following him at more than 100 meters behind.", "Su Mo fully applied his body move to widen the distance between them.", "Shadow Steps were for close combat, so they did not have a great effect on long-distance running.", "Of course, the key reason was that his skills could not be comprehensively applied in the high mountains and the thick forest full of thistles and thorns.", "Besides, Su Mo also had Xi\u2019er on his back.", "\u201cSu Mo, you can\u2019t get away!\u201d the middle-aged man in black yelled behind him.", "Su Mo smiled disdainfully, thinking,\u00a0\u201cIf it weren\u2019t for Xi\u2019er\u2019s safety, you\u2019d be running away from me!\u201d", "\u201cBrother Su Mo, I beg you. Just put me down!\u201d Xi\u2019er said on his back.", "\u201cXi\u2019er, stop! I won\u2019t leave you for as long as I\u2019m alive!\u201d Su Mo said firmly.", "Xi\u2019er felt deeply touched by Su Mo\u2019s words.", "With Xi\u2019er on his back, Su Mo ran like the wind, which caused him to bleed unstoppably.", "\u201cI can\u2019t keep doing this!\u201d", "Su Mo frowned. Bleeding would only make his body weaker.", "\u201cI have an idea!\u201d\u00a0", "Suddenly, Su Mo had an idea and began running in another direction.", "A moment later, he saw a small cave.", "This was the same place where he had found the Purple Spirit Fruit.", "Su Mo entered the cave quickly with Xi\u2019er on his back.", "He glanced around the cave. The corpse of Wei Long, whom he had killed, had been eaten by demonic beasts and reduced to pieces of cloth.", "\u201cXi\u2019er, wait for me here. I\u2019ll go out to kill these dogs,\u201d Su Mo said, putting Xi\u2019er down.", "\u201cBrother Su Mo!\u201d Xi\u2019er firmly grasped Su Mo\u2019s hands, looking worried.", "\u201cDon\u2019t worry! I\u2019ll protect you forever! I can\u2019t be killed easily!\u201d", "Su Mo patted Xi\u2019er\u2019s soft hands and kissed her forehead gently. After that, he turned to leave.", "Xi\u2019er stood there in a daze, like she had been shocked by electricity.", "\u201cI will protect you forever!\u201d\u00a0Feeling the residual warmth on her forehead, Xi\u2019er recalled Su Mo\u2019s words.", "She cried! Her tears flowed down her cheeks!", "However, a joyful smile appeared on her face.", "Su Mo went out of the cave, seeing that it had been surrounded by several men in black.", "At that moment, Su Mo blocked the entrance of the cave, so Xi\u2019er was quite safe.", "Without her on his back, he could easily slaughter these enemies.", "\u201cSu Mo, you have nowhere to run!\u201d the leader said with a cold laugh. He had not expected that Su Mo would be so foolish to hide in a cave.", "Now, Su Mo was trapped like a rat in a hole.", "\u201cWho said I need to escape? It\u2019s time for you to escape!\u201d Su Mo sneered, thinking,\u00a0\u201cThese pieces of trash want to kill me. What a joke!\u201d", "\u201cHow dare you still be so rude on your deathbed!\u201d The middle-aged leader scorned him and shouted, \u201cAttack him!\u201d", "He led the way, chopping his revolving saber toward Su Mo.", "Buzz!", "Su Mo\u2019s refined sword disappeared and was replaced by a silvery long sword.", "It was Spirit-slayer.", "\u201cYou\u2019re courting death!\u201d Su Mo shouted loudly and bore down on the incoming saber without dodging.", "\u201cFinal Hit of Heavenly Wind!\u201d", "Su Mo applied his strongest movement.", "The middle-aged man in black was the leader of the enemies, so if he was killed, the others would not stand a chance.", "His unmatched sword radiance was like dazzling starlight, rising into the sky and tearing through the air.", "The saber and sword then crashed into each other violently.", "Boom!", "A fierce burst of force erupted in all directions.", "Crack!", "The leader\u2019s long saber was broken. The sword radiance halted for a second before shooting toward the leader with full strength.", "\u201cWhat?\u201d", "The leader was frightened, but it was too late for him to dodge, so he could only turn his body to protect his vital organs.", "Slice!", "With a flash of sword radiance, a long arm flew into the air and sprayed red blood everywhere like rain.", "\u201cAh!!\u201d", "The leader screamed, and his face twisted in severe pain.", "He retreated quickly away from Su Mo.", "Su Mo did not attack him again, but instead, he turned and aimed his long sword toward the other men in black.", "\u201cWhoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!\u201d", "Su Mo\u2019s eyes glinted coldly, and his body flitted around, leaving a series of residual shadows as his long sword kept attacking.", "\u201cGale Blade!\u201d", "\u201cSwirling Winds and Clouds!\u201d", "\u201cWind Roaring in the Sky!\u201d", "These men in black only had an Lv 7 Qi cultivation Realm, so they were even weaker than Wei Liang. There was no way they could defeat Su Mo.", "With the Spirit-slayer Sword, Su Mo became so powerful that he could kill a man with each step.", "In no time, the rest of them were all killed.", "\u201cWhat\u2026\u201d", "The injured leader was greatly frightened and stared at Su Mo in horror.", "Realizing that it was impossible to kill Su Mo, he turned to escape quickly without hesitation.", "\u201cWhoosh!\u201d", "Su Mo suddenly sprang forward to block the leader\u2019s path.", "\u201cDo you think you can escape today?\u201d Su Mo asked indifferently.", "\u201cSu Mo, I beg you\u2026 let me go.\u201d", "The leader\u2019s arm was cut off, and he lost a great deal of blood. His complexion turned as white as paper.", "\u201cWell, if you tell me who you are and why you\u2019re trying to kill me, I might consider letting you go,\u201d Su Mo said with a sneer.", "\u201cWe\u2019re guards of the Mansion of the City Governor. His son wants to kill you and capture Xi\u2019er.\u201d The leader concealed nothing from Su Mo.", "He was the same guard who had reported Su Mo\u2019s whereabouts to Lin Xiao.", "He knew that it was impossible for him to go back to the Mansion of the City Governor, for he had failed his task and missed an arm. If he went back, he would be killed.", "Therefore, he did not intend to hide any information.", "\u201cSwish!\u201d", "As Su Mo was lost in thought, the middle-aged man turned around and escaped.", "Having seen Su Mo kill the others in a short time, he knew Su Mo would not let him go.", "\u201cWhoosh!\u201d", "After he ran only a few steps, a sharp sword radiance instantly shot toward him and penetrated his heart.", "Su Mo\u2019s eyes glinted coldly. He was never soft-hearted to his enemies.", "\u201cSo it\u2019s Lin Xiao? He will pay the price for your actions,\u201d Su Mo murmured.", "After all the men in black were killed, Su Mo hurried to enter the cave.", "He saw that Xi\u2019er had come out of the cave and was standing at the entrance, staring at Su Mo.", "\u201cXi\u2019er!\u201d he called toward her.", "\u201cBrother Su Mo!\u201d", "She suddenly ran like the wind to Su Mo and entered his arms, holding his waist tightly.", "Su Mo smelled her elegant fragrance, and he was calmed by the touch of her soft body.", "\u201cXi\u2019er, don\u2019t be afraid! I\u2019ve killed them.\u201d Su Mo patted her back to comfort her.", "After a while, she left Su Mo\u2019s arms, slightly blushing.", "\u201cXi\u2019er, weren\u2019t you curious about how I mummified the demonic beasts?\u201d Su Mo said suddenly, \u201cIn fact, human beings are the same. In a second, I\u2019ll swallow their essence and blood.\u201d", "Su Mo went to the corpses and sat cross-legged, releasing his Martial Soul."]}}
