{"Chapter 9": {" Purple Gold Pavilion": ["Translator:\u00a0Transn\u00a0\u00a0Editor:\u00a0Transn", "Purple Gold Pavilion", "In the yard, Su Mo kept swinging his fist with sharp whistling sounds and layes of fist shadows.", "Bam! Bam! Bam!", "Amidst constant resounding collisions, Su Mo immersed himself in his fistplay.", "He pictured himself as the sea, the genuine Qi as the water, and his fist force as great waves dashing against the rocks and constantly gushing.", "After a long time, he stopped, wiped sweat off his forehead, and sat down in the yard.", "Su Mo had made rapid progress in cultivating Ninefold Ocean Wave Fist. He had already achieved the Great Completion Realm in just two days.", "In\u00a0Ninefold Ocean Wave Fist\u00a0, threefold fist force was a sign of crossing the threshold, fivefold fist force was a sign of Minor Completion, and sevenfold fist force was a sign of Great Completion. Now that he had achieved sevenfold fist force, he was not far from achieving ninefold fist force, which was a sign of the Completion Realm.", "With his strength and physical force nowadays, Su Mo was not afraid of martial artists at Lv 4 Qi Cultivation Realm at all.", "He did not rush to cultivate the scrolls in the storage ring, because it was more urgent to improve his cultivation.", "\u201cI have to find a way to increase the rank of my Martial Soul,\u201d Su Mo murmured to himself.", "He was now performing both Qi Cultivation and Body Refining at the same time. He needed a great amount of Spiritual Qi for Elephants Strength Skill, but his Rank 3 Human Class Martial Soul did not absorb Spiritual Qi quickly enough.", "The only way to improve the rank of a Martial Soul was to devour Beast Souls and other Martial Souls.", "Devouring Martial Souls was not practical for now, since he could not kill people in the city, so he had to devour Beast Souls.", "In addition to hunting for Beast Souls, he could also buy them with gold from any big shop in Sunnywood City.", "However, they were not cheap. The higher the rank of demonic beast, the pricier its Beast Soul was.", "As far as Su Mo knew, the Beast Soul of a demonic beast with Lv 3 or 4 Qi Cultivation Realm usually cost over one kilogram of gold each.", "After pondering for a while, he had an idea and walked to the Master Mansion.", "\u201cHaha! Mo\u2019er, you came just in time. I have something to ask you.\u201d", "In the Master Mansion, Su Hong smiled at his son and asked, \u201cIs it true that you beat Su Heng with just one move the other day?\u201d", "\u201cYes.\u201d Su Mo nodded.", "\u201cHaha! Good, you proved yourself to be my son.\u201d", "After hearing his son confirm it personally, Su Hong was very satisfied. He knew that Su Mo might have encountered some miracles, but he did not inquire about them and just said encouragingly, \u201cMo\u2019er, just keep trying. Even though your Martial Soul doesn\u2019t have a high rank, you may still reach the Spiritual Martial Realm one day.\u201d", "\u201cYes, Father.\u201d", "\u201cAlright. Why are you here?\u201d", "\u201cI have a favor to ask. Please help me,\u201d Su Mo answered earnestly.", "Su Hong was a little bit surprised by Su Mo\u2019s seriousness and said, \u201cMo\u2019er, I\u2019m your father, not a stranger. Tell me what you want, and as long as I can do it, I will never decline.\u201d", "\u201cFather, I need 500 kilograms of gold,\u201d Su Mo said.", "He looked at his father nervously, for fear of refusal.", "500 kilograms of gold was not a small sum. Usually, the income of the entire Su family for a whole year was only 5,000 kilograms of gold, so 500 kilograms of gold was more than the Sus\u2019 monthly income.", "If Su Mo was still regarded as a genius, it would not be difficult to get him 500 kilograms of gold.", "However, with his Martial Soul, he was regarded as a piece of trash. Even if Su Hong managed to get him the gold, he would be under a lot of pressure from the family.", "Su Mo had asked for such a large quantity of gold because he wanted to buy a lot of Beast Souls. As long as he could get enough Beast Souls, the rank of his Martial Soul would soar, and along with it, his cultivation speed.", "Su Hong was surprised. He stared at his son to make sure he was not kidding, but after a while, he nodded and said, \u201cWait here. I\u2019ll be back in a minute.\u201d", "Then, he left.", "He did not ask Su Mo why he asked for so much because he trusted his son.", "Su Mo waited in silence, and soon, Su Hong returned.", "\u201cHere are the gold tickets for 500 kilograms of gold. Take them!\u201d Su Hong passed Su Mo several gold tickets.", "Holding the tickets, Su Mo took a deep breath and said, \u201cFather, I won\u2019t let you down in the clan meeting in 2 months.\u201d", "\u2026", "Su Mo headed toward the marketplace.", "After an hour, he stood at the door of a big store. It had a gilded tablet with bold script that read: Purple Gold Pavilion.", "Purple Gold Pavilion was a three-storey tower covering over 100 acres. It was the biggest store in the entire city. As long as you had enough money, you could get any cultivation skill, elixir, weapon, or anything else related to cultivation.", "It was said that Purple Gold Pavilion had powerful connections, belonged to a major chamber, and had branches in many cities in Skymoon Country.", "It held so much power in Sunnywood City that even the Sus and the Weis dared not to get in trouble with it.", "\u201cHow can I help you?\u201d asked a young and beautiful maid reverently as Su Mo entered the pavilion.", "\u201cI want to buy some Beast Souls,\u201d Su Mo answered.", "\u201cYou want to buy Beast Souls? Come with me!\u201d", "Su Mo soon followed her to a counter that specialized in Beast Souls, where there stood an old man in gray. He smiled and asked, \u201cCould you tell me what rank of Beast Souls you want to buy?\u201d", "\u201cHow much Beast Souls of Middle Lv 1 cost?\u201d Su Mo asked.", "A Beast Soul of Middle Lv 1 was of Class 4 Lv 1, Class 5 Lv 1, or Class 6 Lv 1.", "\u201cClass 4 Lv 1 Beast Souls cost one and a half kilograms of gold each, Class 5 Lv 1 Beast Souls are two and a half kilograms, and Class 6 Lv 1 Beast Souls are five kilograms,\u201d the old man answered.", "\u201cI\u2019ll take 200 Class 5 Lv 1 Beast Souls,\u201d Su Mo said after some quick consideration.", "He had devoured a lot of Beast Souls in Breezewind Mountain, so he knew that Beast Souls of higher rank were more effective.", "While the prices of Beast Souls doubled with each one level, his Martial Soul was only at Rank 3, so Class 5 Lv 1 Beast Souls were enough for him.", "\u201cWhat?\u201d", "The old man was so astonished, so he checked again:\u201dAre you sure you are taking 200 Class 5 Lv 1 Beast Souls?\u201d", "\u201cYes, is there a problem?\u201d Su Mo asked.", "\u201cI can\u2019t call the shots for such a grand deal. I need to inform the leader of Pavilion. Please wait a moment!\u201d the old man answered and rushed into the backyard of Purple Gold Pavilion.", "Su Mo could do nothing but wait.", "Soon, the old man rushed back and told Su Mo, \u201cThe leader of Pavilion would like to meet you.\u201d", "\u201cShow me the way,\u201d Su Mo said.", "In the backyard of Purple Gold Pavilion, there was a small house. Su Mo followed the old man into a side hall.", "He was stunned when he got inside.", "There was an extraordinarily stunning woman sitting in the hall.", "She looked like she was in her late 20s, with refined facial features on her charming face, and her skin was snow-white. She wore a tight leather skirt that fit her curvy body perfectly.", "This was an enchanting beauty with peerless charm!", "She was the leader of Pavilion, Luo Huan."]}}
