{"Chapter 17": {" Kill Them All": ["Translator:\u00a0Transn\u00a0\u00a0Editor:\u00a0Transn", "The bandit leader was incredibly shocked by Su Mo\u2019s abilities.", "He was fully aware of his own strength, and common Lv 5 Qi Cultivation Realm martial artists were no match for him.", "How could he not be shocked that he was forced back by a Lv 3 martial artist?", "\u201cAhhh!\u201d", "While the bandit leader was lost in confusion, two more screams tore through the air.", "Su Mo\u2019s sword was as fast as lightning and as nimble as wind, so his sword Qi was unstoppable.", "Three more bandits were instantly killed.", "This small group of bandits used to have 20 men. However, Su Mo killed nine men before, and he just killed three more, so now there were only eight left.", "\u201cDie!\u201d Su Mo\u00a0yelled, his body as swift as a flash. With a glint of his sword, two more bandits were slashed in the waist and collapsed to the ground, spilling their guts everywhere.", "\u201cHurry! Surround and kill him! Hurry!\u201d screamed the bandit leader.", "He raised his giant war saber and charged toward Su Mo.", "This time, Su Mo did not directly block his attack. He used his swiftness to weave between the men, and with every flash of his sword, he struck down a bandit.", "\u201cScrew you!\u201d roared the bandit leader angrily. No matter how hard he swung his war saber, he had never touched a hair on Su Mo\u2019s body.", "After Su Mo practiced the Lower Lv 3 body move,\u00a0Shadow Steps\u00a0, his dexterity had been greatly increased. Although he had only begun to cultivate\u00a0Shadow Steps\u00a0, his movement was way beyond the bandit leader\u2019s capabilities.", "Besides their leader, the other bandits were all at Lv 3 or Lv 4 Qi Cultivation Realm, so very few stood a chance against Su Mo\u2019s sword.", "Even if they blocked one strike, they could not block another.", "With Sword Qi spreading everywhere and sword radiance shining, Su Mo killed one man with every step he took.", "Soon, the bandit leader had become a commander without soldiers.", "Even the men who tried to run were killed by a single strike before they could get away.", "\u201cYou\u2019ve killed so many men of my Bloody Blade Stockade! I won\u2019t let you get away with it!\u201d", "The bandit leader issued this threat but turned around to run away. He could tell that he was at a disadvantage.", "There was no way that he could kill his opponent!", "\u201cYou\u2019re going nowhere!\u201d", "Su Mo blocked the bandit leader\u2019s path.", "\u201cDon\u2019t push me! Even though I can\u2019t kill you, you also can\u2019t kill me!\u201d The bandit leader yelled.", "\u201cReally? I\u2019ve told you that you will all die today!\u201d", "Su Mo sneered condescendingly, which immediately enraged the bandit leader.", "\u201cYou must be looking for death! I\u2019ll show you just how powerful I am.\u201d", "The bandit leader roared, and his Martial Soul rose up behind him, bathed in yellow light.", "His Martial Soul was a three-meter-tall Fierce Bear.", "After activating his Martial Soul, the bandit leader\u2019s abilities at least multiplied. He drew out his shining war saber and swung it forcefully towards Su Mo.", "Su Mo did not dodge it and stood silently in place.", "The bandit leader was overjoyed to see this, and he channeled all his force into his swing to incapacitate Su Mo with one strike.", "Su Mo smiled coldly. When the bandit leader\u2019s war saber was about to come down, he sheathed his sword.", "This action instantly shocked the bandit leader.", "\u201cIs this boy dumb?\u201d", "However, he was even more excited. Now that his enemy had sheathed his weapon, this was his chance to kill him.", "Just as the bandit leader\u2019s war saber was about to reach Su Mo, a shining long sword appeared in Su Mo\u2019s hand with a flash.", "This was the Spirit-slayer Sword, a Medium Lv 4 weapon.", "Su Mo grasped the Spirit-slayer Sword and swung it up to meet the war saber.", "Clang! Splash!", "When the weapons met, the bandit leader\u2019s war saber was shattered. The Spirit-slayer Sword did not lose any momentum and cut through the bandit leader\u2019s neck like lightning, causing his head to fly up and spew blood everywhere.", "Huff!", "Su Mo let out a sigh after killing all of the bandits.", "\u201cSpirit-slayer Sword, you didn\u2019t let me down!\u201d", "Su Mo looked at the longsword in his hands and smiled. His Medium Lv 4 weapon was really exceptional.", "Weapons of different levels and grades varied greatly in quality, not to mention that the bandit leader\u2019s weapon was a common Lv 1.", "Since the two weapons were not even at the same level, it was not surprising that his sword could slice through the war saber.", "When faced with these degenerates, Su Mo was not stupid enough to fight fairly.", "After killing all the bandits, Su Mo looked towards the kidnapped women, who were all shell-shocked and unresponsive.", "\u201cAlright, all of the bandits have been killed! You\u2019re all free!\u201d", "Su Mo said, waking the women.", "\u201cThank you, kind sir!\u201d", "All the women kneeled on the ground and bowed their heads to Su Mo in thanks.", "\u201cYou can all get up! It isn\u2019t safe here. Go back to your village first!\u201d", "Su Mo waved his hand and asked them to stand. Although their village had been destroyed, he could only ask them to go back.", "Luckily, most of the bandits had war horses that the women could ride back to the village.", "\u201cSir, I\u2019ll never forget your kind deed today. Could you tell me your name? I\u2019ll bear it in mind forever.\u201d", "A young girl in green quietly said as she nervously walked up to Su Mo.", "She was the girl whom the scar-faced bandit had lusted after, and the one who was being taken as a gift to chief brigands.", "Her skin was as white as snow, her beauty unparalleled, and her eyes as clear as a spring. Although she was wearing rags, she exuded an undeniable elegance.", "The girl had the appearance of a fallen angel, making her desirable but incorruptable.", "Su Mo had only just realized this outstanding beauty among the women.", "\u201cHow could such a small village produce such a gem?\u201d", "Judging purely by appearance, this girl surpassed even Luo Huan, the leader of Purple Gold Pavilion. However, she seemed shyer than the charismatic Luo Huan.", "\u201cMy name is Su Mo! Go back first, and I\u2019ll come later and help you bury your relatives.\u201d", "Su Mo smiled and led a war horse over to her.", "\u201cYes, sir.\u201d The girl lightly nodded.", "After everyone had left, Su Mo stared at the pile of corpses with excitement glinting in his eyes.", "\u201cWith all these blood\u00a0essence\u00a0, breaking through my cultivation shouldn\u2019t be a problem!\u201d", "Su Mo immediately walked over, sat down cross-legged, and released his Devouring Martial Spirit.", "The longer he waited, the more essence these bodies would lose. Moreover, their Martial Souls would disappear after a while, which would be a great loss!", "Su Mo used all his force to activate his Devouring Martial Spirit, which quickly sucked in all the bandits\u2019 Martial Souls and Blood Qi.", "Most of these bandits\u2019 Martial Souls were Rank 2 or 3 Human Class, so Su Mo\u2019s Martial Soul was not affected after devouring them.", "However, the great amount of Blood Qi became a surge of pure energy after it was devoured and absorbed into Su Mo\u2019s body.", "Su Mo suddenly experienced a spike in genuine Qi!", "Boom!", "In the blink of an eye, Su Mo\u2019s cultivation broke through the bottleneck of Lv 3 and entered into Lv 4 Qi Cultivation Realm.", "The Blood Qi was so strong that Su Mo\u2019s cultivation continued to rise after reaching Level Four.", "Early Lv 4 Qi Cultivation Realm!", "Middle Lv 4 Qi Cultivation Realm!", "Late Lv 4 Qi Cultivation Realm!", "Peak Lv 4 Qi Cultivation Realm!", "Finally, after Su Mo finished devouring everyone\u2019s Blood Qi, his cultivation stopped at Peak Lv 4 Qi Cultivation Realm, which was only a step away from Lv 5.", "He was not disappointed and was instead satisfied that he had increased his cultivation by one level.", "\u201cIf I keep killing and taking other people\u2019s Blood Qi and Martial Souls like this, won\u2019t my cultivation skyrocket?\u201d Su Mo thought excitedly.", "However, he shook his head.\u00a0\u201cIf I continue this, even though my strength will improve quickly, I will also lose my humanity and become a bloodthirsty monster.\u201d", "Su Mo had always been a moral person who had no sympathy for enemies and villains, but slaughtering the innocent was no different from those bandits.", "Then, he took a deep breath, stood up, took all of the mummies\u2019 belongings and left."]}}
