{"Chapter 8": {" Worse than Trash": ["Translator:\u00a0Transn\u00a0\u00a0Editor:\u00a0Transn", "The martial practice field of the Sus, Sunnywood City.", "Dozens of inferior Su disciples were gathered on the large martial practice field.", "A middle-aged man in a gray robe sat in the center of the field, describing his martial arts experience to the inferiors.", "He was Su Tai, the Fourth Elder of the Sus.", "The inferiors present had all recently awakened their Martial Souls.", "They had just reached the Qi Cultivation Realm and lacked cultivation experiences, so the Sus arranged for elders to speak to them.", "As one of the three major clans in the city, the Sus had many more inferior disciples than the ones present. Some of the older disciples had awakened their Martial Souls two years ago, even reaching Lv 7 or 8 Qi Cultivation Realm.", "Those disciples with high cultivations would not attend these lectures.", "After returning, Su Mo spotted the Fourth Elder in the field and walked over to him.", "\u201cSu Mo, all the other disciples who awakened their Martial Souls with you arrived a long time ago. Why are you only showing up now?\u201d", "The Fourth Elder paused his lesson and sullenly asked the unhurried Su Mo.", "It was a great honor to attend a lecture given by him, and all the other disciples came early to wait for him, yet Su Mo\u2019s late arrival showed that he had no respect for the elder.", "Many of the disciples smirked to see Su Mo get into trouble.", "Su Mo never expected the Fourth Elder to scold him for being late, since elders\u2019 lectures were completely optional.", "\u201cFourth Elder, I just returned from an expedition,\u201d Su Mo respectfully replied.", "\u201cExpedition?\u201d", "The Fourth Elder smirked and said, \u201cWith your crappy Martial Soul? You won\u2019t achieve anything great in your lifetime. You have nothing to experience!\u201d", "Su Mo\u2019s expression instantly became cold, and he huffed, \u201cFourth Elder, I respect you because you\u2019re an elder, but you should know that an elder without good qualities isn\u2019t worthy of respect!\u201d", "\u201cWhat? Are you saying I\u2019m unworthy of respect?\u201d", "The Fourth Elder was fuming. How dare a useless fool, a piece of trash provoke him?", "\u201cDoesn\u2019t calling me trash as an elder make you unworthy of respect?\u201d", "Su Mo was also infuriated. Ever since he awakened his Martial Soul, not only did inferior disciples despise him, now even elders treated him with contempt.", "Did they all think he could be easily bullied?", "It seemed that he should not keep a low profile in the future!", "\u201cHow dare you!\u201d", "The Fourth Elder shouted in rage. \u201cAm I wrong? Aren\u2019t you trash and a useless fool with your Rank 1 Human Class Martial Soul? Is there anyone else in the city with such a crappy martial soul?\u201d", "\u201cThat\u2019s right! You\u2019re nothing but trash! You\u2019re a disgrace to our clan!\u201d", "One of the disciples yelled.", "Su Mo turned his head and saw that it was Su Heng who had spoken.", "With Su Heng\u2019s words, other disciples followed suit.", "\u201cRight! Rank 1 Human Class! You\u2019re a good-for-nothing!\u201d", "\u201cThat\u2019s right! Shame on you!\u201d", "\u201c\u2026\u201d", "Su Heng laughed as many disciples echoed him. He looked at Su Mo and said, \u201cSu Mo, so many people are calling you trash and a good-for-nothing. Do you know your place?\u201d", "The Fourth Elder laughed and said with a sneer, \u201cSu Mo, I told you so!\u201d", "Su Mo walked up to Su Heng and said, \u201cSu Heng, you call me a piece of trash and a good-for-nothing, but let me ask you this: if you find out you\u2019re not as good as me, what does that make you?\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019m not as good as you? Haha! This is the funniest joke I\u2019ve ever heard.\u201d Su Heng sneered.", "Not as good as Su Mo?", "He had to be joking.", "Su Mo\u2019s eyes glinted coldly, and he said with a smile, \u201cSu Heng, I\u2019m issuing you a challenge. Do you dare to accept it?\u201d", "His words silenced everyone.", "They all looked at Su Mo in disbelief.", "Su Mo actually challenged Su Heng?", "Su Heng was also stunned. After he awakened a Martial Soul of the Rank 4 Human Class, his position in the clan rose greatly, and he was awarded many family resources, which allowed him to reach Lv 3 Qi Cultivation Realm.", "Yet, this good-for-nothing Su Mo still dared to challenge him?", "The Fourth Elder was the first to respond. He said to Su Heng in a hurry, \u201cSince he wants to challenge you, you should teach him a lesson.\u201d", "Su Mo\u2019s earlier provocation had angered him. As an elder, he could not directly punish his inferior, but luckily, Su Mo presented the opportunity himself.", "\u201cHaha! Don\u2019t worry, Fourth Elder! I definitely won\u2019t disappoint you!\u201d", "Su Heng smiled and walked towards Su Mo, his eyes flickering with malice.", "Ever since Su Mo provoked him in the Book Collection Pavilion, he had been looking for an opportunity to teach him a lesson!", "This unexpected challenge greatly excited him.", "\u201cSu Mo, how many moves of mine can you endure? Three? Or just one?\u201d", "Now that he was about to beat up Su Mo, he was in a very good mood.", "Su Mo lifted his index finger and shook it.", "\u201cHaha! You\u2019re quite self-aware! At least, you\u2019re aware that you can only endure one move.\u201d Su Heng chuckled.", "\u201cNo! I mean I only need one move to deal with you,\u201d Su Mo shook his head and said calmly.", "Su Mo was not being cocky. Even without using genuine Qi, his physical strength was far more powerful than that of a martial artist of Level 3 Qi Cultivation Realm, rivaling the power of a martial artist of Level 4.", "\u201cOne Move!\u201d", "Everyone was shocked by Su Mo\u2019s words and thought he was a retard.", "Even between martial artists of the same level, it was rare for one to defeat the other with one move. Never mind Su Mo, whose cultivation was much lower than Su Heng\u2019s.", "Defeating Su Heng with one move! They really had no idea if Su Mo was conceited or idiotic!", "\u201cDefeat me with one move?\u201d", "Su Heng became unpleasant. He did not think a piece of trash like Su Mo would dare look down on him like this.", "\u201cIf I don\u2019t cripple you today, my name won\u2019t be Su Heng!\u201d", "Boom!", "With a roar, Su Heng immediately released his Martial Soul, and four yellow halos shined behind him.", "Rank 4 Human Class Martial Soul!", "Su Heng\u2019s Martial Soul was a majestic goshawk with sharp eyes.", "After he released his Martial Soul, Su Heng\u2019s aura rose sharply.", "His cultivation completely exploded.", "\u201cDie, Su Mo!\u201d", "Su Heng roared and was the first to strike, clawing at Su Mo\u2019s chest.", "Su Heng used his strongest skill so he could defeat Su Mo in one move and let Su Mo know the distance between them.", "He also wanted Su Mo to know what a joke his earlier pride was!", "Su Mo raised his hand and punched Su Heng\u2019s claw.", "This was a regular punch without using Martial Soul or Genuine Qi.", "Su Heng sneered. This good-for-nothing was so arrogant that he wanted to stop him with a punch? Impossible!", "\u201cI\u2019ll break you!\u201d", "Genuine Qi swiftly spewed from Su Heng\u2019s hand, and his five fingers turned to silver spears. He wanted to break Su Mo\u2019s fist.", "What happened next was completely unexpected.", "When his claw hit Su Mo\u2019s fist, Su Heng felt a strong force that pushed his hand away and hit his chest.", "Bang!", "The fist squarely landed on Su Heng\u2019s chest. A raging force surged from Su Mo\u2019s fist, fracturing his chest with the sound of cracking bones. Su Heng was thrown about six meters away and crashed on the ground, spewing blood.", "The audience was completely silent. All eyes were frozen on him.", "Su Mo defeated Su Heng with a single punch?", "The Fourth Elder looked at Su Heng, who was lying on the ground in a daze.", "\u201cHow could it be\u2026 How could it be?\u201d", "Su Heng was unable to accept the outcome and roared angrily with a twisted expression. However, just after he finished shouting, he was spitting blood again.", "\u201cYou called me a piece trash and a good-for-nothing every time you opened your mouth, but this piece of trash just defeated you with a single punch. Doesn\u2019t that make you worse than trash?\u201d", "Su Mo said mockingly, walking to Su Heng and looking down on him.", "\u201cYou\u2026 \u201d Su Heng looked livid, ashamed, and resentful.", "\u201cAnd you, Fourth Elder. Do you still think I\u2019m useless now? I\u2019ve defeated your prodigy, Su Heng, whom you thought highly of. What is he now?\u201d", "Su Mo looked at the Fourth Elder.", "\u201cYou only won through sheer luck. You have nothing to be smug about!\u201d", "The Fourth Elder\u2019s expression was unpleasant. \u201cThe year-end clan meeting is in two months. When that time comes, you\u2019ll realize the true abilities of the outstanding talents in our clan. You\u2019re nothing compared to them!\u201d", "\u201cThrough sheer luck?\u201d Su Mo said with a smile, \u201cI am quite lucky. Perhaps \u201cthrough sheer luck\u201d, I can achieve a high ranking in the clan meeting.\u201d", "At that, he turned around and left."]}}
