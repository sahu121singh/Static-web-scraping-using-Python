{"Chapter 15": {" Bloody Blade Stockade": ["Translator:\u00a0Transn\u00a0\u00a0Editor:\u00a0Transn", "On a shady path 80 kilometers away from Sunnywood City, with the long sword on his back, Su Mo used his body movement to rush toward Breezewind Mountain", "Breezewind Mountain was over 100 kilometers away from Sunnywood City, but with his speed, he could reach it within one hour.", "\u201cHmm? It smells really strongly of blood!\u201d", "On his way to the mountain, Su Mo keenly smelled blood in the air.", "\u201cWhat happened?\u201d", "\u201cWhere from?\u201d", "He stopped, and after some pondering, he decided to follow the smell.", "After a while, he came across a small village with about 100 households.", "However, the whole village was in ruins. Most of the houses had collapsed, and corpses scattered on the ground.", "Scarlet blood dyed the ground and converged into streams, making the place look like hell itself.", "That was where the thick smell of blood was coming from.", "\u201cWhat is this?\u201d", "Su Mo was quite appalled at this sight, even though he thought he had seen everything.", "\u201cWho could be so vicious to slaughter an entire village?\u201d", "He was extremely incensed, and his eyes grew cold.", "After taking a deep breath, he rushed into the village.", "The whole village was dead silent, but the strewn corpses, broken limbs, and scarlet blood were everywhere. It was appalling.", "Many of the corpses were dead women, children, and old people. He saw a three or four-year-old little girl lying in a pool of her own blood, with a knife stabbed through her body.", "All of these things made him very angry, and his face darkened.", "\u201cWho is so inhumane that he can commit such a formidable crime?\u201d", "\u201cAh! Ah!\u201d", "Suddenly, he heard a faint groaning sound.", "Su Mo hastily ran toward the sound, and he soon arrived at a collapsed ruin and found an old, gray-haired man.", "The old man was covered in blood with half of his body crushed under the ruin. He was heavily wounded, but still alive.", "\u201cSir, are you alright?\u201d", "Su Mo hurriedly walked forward, removed the ruins, and helped the old man up.", "He realized that the old man\u2019s stomach had been cut open, and his guts were flowing out. There was no chance he could survive.", "\u201cWhat I\u2019ve done to you, my Lord! It\u2019s unfair! Ooh, ooh\u2026!\u201d The old man was in a daze and burst into tears.", "\u201cSir, what happened?\u201d Su Mo asked him.", "The old man stopped crying and regained consciousness gradually.", "\u201cPlease save my granddaughter! Please! Please!\u201d implored the old man as he looked at Su Mo and abruptly grabbed his hands.", "\u201cSir, don\u2019t worry! Just tell me what happened,\u201d Su Mo asked.", "\u201cThe Bloody Blade Stockade looted our village and slaughtered all of us.\u201d", "The old man was in grief, yet his eyes were filled with resentment.", "\u201cThe Bloody Blade Stockade?\u201d", "Su Mo\u2019s eyes narrowed, for he had heard of the Bloody Blade Stockade.", "It was said that the Bloody Blade Stockade was a bunch of bandits stationed 100 kilometers from Sunnywood City who often committed cruel crimes like this.", "They were evil in every way, but they were very smart to not attack powerful groups and only targeted the weak.", "Therefore, the Bloody Blade Stockade had always gotten their way for years instead of being uprooted.", "\u201cHow many were there? What\u2019s their strength?\u201d", "Su Mo\u2019s eyes were cold, and he felt a raging desire to kill them.", "\u201cIt was a small team with about 20 people, but they all were powerful martial artists above Lv 3 Qi Cultivation Realm.\u201d", "The old man had lost too much blood, and his voice trailed off. \u201cOur village had only five martial artists of the Qi Cultivation Realm, and none of them could rival them, so they were all killed in a short time!\u201d", "\u201cYoung man, please save my granddaughter. She was abducted, and as long as you can save her, I\u2019ll be your servant in my next life.\u201d", "He pleaded to Su Mo, without considering if Su Mo would be able to defeat those bandits.", "Judging from Su Mo\u2019s expensive clothes, the old man could tell that he was an inferior of some big clan, so he would certainly save his granddaughter.", "\u201cSir, don\u2019t worry! You got it.\u201d", "Su Mo nodded seriously.", "He was experiencing a mix of emotions. He knew that the laws of nature dictated that the strong would always be to prey upon the weak.", "\u201cWell! Well! Thank you\u2026!\u201d", "The old man gave him a faint smile, then his head tilted, and he died.", "\u201cThe Bloody Blade Stockade, huh?\u201d", "Su Mo stood up with his fists clenched, and his eyebrows furrowed with killing desire. \u201cYou dirtbags don\u2019t deserve to live.\u201d", "Then, he dashed off and followed the horse tracks out of the village.", "The village had just been robbed, so the bandits should still have been nearby.", "He was going to kill all of those animals.", "\u2026", "\u201cGiddy up! Giddy up!\u201d", "The Bloody Blade Stockade bandits spurred their war horses along a mountainous path.", "They were slowed down by the 20 to 30 ladies they had captured.", "Some of these ladies were 30 or 40 years old, and some were only 12 or 13 years old. No matter if they were married women or maidens, they were all very pretty.", "\u201cBrothers, let\u2019s take a rest here and continue after a meal,\u201d ordered the tall leader of the bandits.", "Soon, the bandits stopped to rest. They lit a bonfire and roasted some game.", "Then, they gathered all the ladies together.", "\u201cHaha! I didn\u2019t expect so many pretty women this time. I can\u2019t wait any longer!\u201d", "A bandit smiled disgustingly and lewdly looked at those ladies.", "\u201cHaha! I haven\u2019t touched a woman for over a month, so let\u2019s really enjoy ourselves this time!\u201d", "Another scar-faced bandit laughed, fixed his eyes on a maiden in green, and said creepily, \u201cThis girl is beautiful! Damn! I\u2019ve never seen such a pretty girl in my life.\u201d", "A 15-year-old maiden in green stood out among the ladies with her outstanding looks, which attracted the bandits\u2019 attention.", "The simple clothes on her could not disguise her elegance.", "\u201cHumph! If you want to save your little ass, you\u2019d better leave her alone. I\u2019m about to give her to the chief!\u201d The leader scolded coldly.", "\u201cHaha! Since she\u2019s a give for the chief, I won\u2019t touch her.\u201d", "The scar-faced bandit shivered at the thought of the chief\u2019s cruelty and gave the leader a big smile.", "Thud! Thud! Thud!", "\u201cHmm?\u201d", "Right at that moment, one of the ladies started to run away while the bandits were not paying attention and made it dozens of meters away in the blink of an eye.", "\u201cHaha! Leader, leave her to me!\u201d", "The scar-faced bandit laughed coldly and chased her in excitement, catching her in no time.", "\u201cHaha! Little cunt, trying to run under my watch? I\u2019ll teach you a lesson right now!\u201d", "He chuckled vilely and dragged her into a grassy field.", "\u201cAh!\u201d", "Not long after he disappeared, a loud scream emerged from the grass."]}}
