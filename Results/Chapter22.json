{"Chapter 22": {" Ten-to-One Odds": ["Translator:\u00a0Transn\u00a0\u00a0Editor:\u00a0Transn", "The days leading up to Su Mo and Wei Liang\u2019s fight flew by quickly.", "Today, Su Mo would fight with Wei Liang.", "On the day of the fight, no less than 1000 people filled Central Square in Sunnywood City, and they were bustling with chatter.", "\u201cI didn\u2019t think a fight between two young disciples would attract so many people!\u201d", "\u201cExactly! The Master and elders of the Weis, as well as people from Mansion of City Governor have all come.\u201d", "\u201cMany people from the Sus also come! Their Master and first elder are here, too!\u201d", "\u201cWho do you think will win today\u2019s fight to the death?\u201d", "\u201cWho do you think? Of course, Wei Liang will!\u201d", "\u201cI don\u2019t think so. I\u2019ve heard Su Mo is quite strong and even beat up the son of the city governor the other day.\u201d", "\u201cEven so, Su Mo is no match for Wei Liang. I\u2019ve heard Wei Liang\u2019s cultivation has reached the peak Lv 6 Qi Cultivation Realm.\u201d", "\u201c\u2026\u201d", "A simple spectator stand had been set up in the square.", "The Weis sat on the left. Wei Wankong sat in the middle, with elders flanking him and inferior disciples behind him, including Wei Liang.", "On the right sat the Sus. Su Hong, the first elder, and some other elders were here, too.", "Su Heng and the other disciples stood behind them.", "Besides the Weis and the Sus, many big shots in Sunnywood City sat there, who were here on the Weis\u2019 invitation.", "The Weis wanted everyone in the city to witness a disciple from their family sadistically kill the young master of the Sus.", "\u201cSu Hong, why isn\u2019t your son here yet? Does he get cold feet?\u201d Wei Wankong glanced at Su Hong and asked mockingly after noticing Su Mo\u2019s absence.", "\u201cHumph! Don\u2019t worry! Since my son dared to accept the challenge, he\u2019ll definitely come!\u201d Su Hong huffed back coldly.", "Wei Wankong sneered and thought, \u201cGloat on! Let\u2019s see how smug you\u2019ll be when your son dies!\u201d", "\u201cSu Mo\u2019s here!\u201d", "Loud cheers came from the outside of the square.", "The crowd automatically parted to make way for a young man and lady.", "The young man was carrying a long sword and was very handsome, while the young lady was such a beauty that she drew everyone\u2019s attention.", "They were Su Mo and Xi\u2019er.", "Everyone thought that they were such a lovely match, but they also lamented that Su Mo would die very soon.", "Su Mo and Xi\u2019er walked onto the spectators stand toward Su Hong.", "\u201cFather.\u201d Su Mo saluted Su Hong.", "\u201cMo\u2019er, I look forward to your performance,\u201d said Su Hong with a nod.", "\u201cSu Mo, since you\u2019re already here, let\u2019s not waste any time!\u201d Wei Wankong sneered as he glanced at Su Mo. He then looked around and loudly said, \u201cLadies and gentlemen, today is the voluntary fight to the death between Wei Liang of our family and Su Mo of the Sus. Let Heaven determine their lives! With you all as witnesses, neither family can challenge the outcome afterward!\u201d", "\u201cLet Heaven determine their lives!\u201d", "\u201cLet Heaven determine their lives!\u201d", "The crowd was instantly invigorated and cheered.", "A wide smile appeared on Wei Wankong\u2019s\u00a0face. He said all of this, because he believed that Su Mo would undoubtedly die today.", "However, if Su Hong lost his mind after his son\u2019s death and recklessly waged war against the Weis, there would be horrible consequences.", "Now that he had said this in front of countless citizens of Sunnywood City, Su Hong would have no reason to argue after Su Mo\u2019s death.", "\u201cAlright. Let\u2019s begin!\u201d", "Wei Wankong took his seat again and nodded to Wei Liang, who was standing behind him.", "With a spear in his hand, Wei Liang stepped out and flew to the center of the square.", "\u201cSu Mo, come and meet your death!\u201d", "Wei Liang glared at Su Mo murderously with his long spear pointing to him.", "Su Mo glanced at his opponent and turned to Xi\u2019er, saying, \u201cXi\u2019er, stay by my father\u2019s side.\u201d", "He was about to leave and meet Wei Liang\u2019s challenge when Xi\u2019er grabbed the hem of his clothes.", "\u201cBrother Su Mo!\u201d Xi\u2019er looked extremely worried.", "\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Xi\u2019er. I\u2019ll be fine,\u201d said Su Mo while patting her hand to comfort her.", "Suddenly, a loud voice came from outside of the square.", "\u201cPurple Gold Pavilion is starting a handicap. The odds of Wei Liang\u2019s victory is one-to-one. The odds of Su Mo\u2019s victory is ten-to-one. Hurry up and place your bets!\u201d", "Hearing this, many went to place their bets.", "Most betted on Wei Liang\u2019s victory.", "Su Mo was momentarily speechless and cursed in his head,\u00a0\u201cTen-to-one odds? Purple Gold Pavilion is really looking down on me!\u201d", "\u201cMaster, we\u2019re going to place some bets as well!\u201d said the elders of the Sus with malice in their eyes.", "The First Elder Su Yue, the Fourth Elder Su Tai, and the others wagered a good deal of money on the outcome.", "Though they were from the Sus, they betted on Wei Liang\u2019s victory. How ironic!", "A few people nearby, who were hesitating, made their decisions when they saw that even the elders of the Sus made such a bet.", "\u201cPurple Gold Pavilion will rake in a huge profit this time!\u201d\u00a0thought Su Mo with the tempting figure of Luo Huan flashing in his mind.", "As so many people bet on Wei Liang, Purple Gold Pavilion would earn a fortune if Su Mo won.", "\u201cFather, go and bet on me! The money is ours to take!\u201d", "With his ten-to-one odds, a bet of 50kg of gold would make a return of 500kg. How could he let such a great opportunity slip out of his hands?", "\u201cAlright! I\u2019ll bet 100kg of gold on you!\u201d Su Hong smiled and placed his bet on Su Mo.", "\u201cHaha! Since Master Su is so confident, we will definitely match you on that!\u201d", "Wei Wankong laughed and wagered a decent amount of money on Wei Liang.", "The Weis was ecstatic about how easy it would be to make money from this obvious outcome.", "After everyone placed their bets, Su Mo flew onto the field in a flash and stopped 10 meters away from Wei Liang.", "The fight was about to start!", "People fixed their gazes on the field.", "\u201cSu Mo, this date next year will be the anniversary of your death.\u201d", "Wei Liang sneered. He did not see Su Mo as a worthy opponent at all.", "\u201cReally? Wei Liang, I suggest you give this fight your all strength today. Otherwise, you don\u2019t even deserve my full effort,\u201d Su Mo said with a smile.", "\u201cHow dare you speak so arrogantly!\u201d Wei Liang angrily shouted and said, \u201cI hope you won\u2019t kneel down and beg for mercy later, but even if you do that, I still won\u2019t let you live.\u201d", "\u201cAre you done with your nonsense? Hurry up and attack! I don\u2019t have all day,\u201d Su Mo said calmly with a relaxed expression.", "\u201cDie for your arrogance!\u201d", "Wei Liang was completely enraged with genuine Qi spreading all over his body and turning into a fierce sweeping wind.", "\u2026", "Su Yu and Liu Yushan stood closely together among the crowd of spectators, watching the two fighters on the field.", "\u201cYushan, I didn\u2019t want to come, but you insisted. What\u2019s so interesting about a predictable fight?\u201d Su Yu shrugged and said flatly.", "\u201cThough his talent is too poor to deserve me, he\u2019s still my cousin and was very kind to me in my childhood. He\u2019s fighting to the death today, so I have to come.\u201d Liu Yushan sighed.", "She still harbored feelings for Su Mo, but those feelings meant nothing in the face of martial arts. Thus, she had abandoned them without hesitation.", "\u201cWei Liang\u2019s cultivation is at the Lv 6 Qi Cultivation Realm. Even I can\u2019t defeat him easily, not to mention that failure, Su Mo!\u201d", "Su Yu pursed his lips and said with certainty, \u201cFor some reason, Su Mo\u2019s strength has greatly improved recently, but at most, he\u2019s at the Lv 4. He\u2019ll be killed by Wei Liang with one move\u2026\u201d", "Before Su Yu could finish speaking, his face froze.", "Su Mo had completely released his breath at the Lv 5 Qi Cultivation Realm.", "\u201cEven if he\u2019s at the Lv 5, he\u2019ll still be defeated eventually.\u201d Su Yu scoffed with an unpleasant look on his face.", "As the top genius in the Sus, he had just reached the Lv 6 with the help of plenty of resources from the family.", "How did Su Mo with his rubbish Martial Soul reach the Lv 5 so unexpectedly?", "How did he cultivate this?", "Su Yu could not understand this."]}}
