{"Chapter 24": {" A Crushing Victory": ["Translator:\u00a0Transn\u00a0\u00a0Editor:\u00a0Transn", "Su Mo\u2019s sword hurtled towards Wei Liang\u2019s neck like a traceless bolt of lightning.", "\u201cWhat?\u201d", "Wei Liang was so startled that all his hairs stood on end, and an acute fear arose in his heart.", "He had never seen such strange swordsmanship before.", "\u201cFast!\u201d", "\u201cSo fast that it moved without a trace!\u201d", "Wei Liang had no time to duck, so he let out a shout and used his spear to block his body.", "Clang!", "As the long sword hit the spear, Wei Liang felt a strong jolt travel through his body. His arms went numb, and he was forced to stumble back.", "Su Mo\u2019s blood was boiling, and Qi blood was pouring profusely from him. His first strike did not hit its target, so he swung his force again with powerful genuine Qi and physical force.", "\u201cGale Blade!\u201d", "The sword ray glinted and pierced the air, and its shadow swept toward Wei Liang\u2019s head.", "Huff!", "Wei Liang shouted and waved his spear, forming a shield against Su Mo\u2019s sword.", "Boom!", "The long sword swung down violently, and its immense force sent Wei Liang flying back a dozen meters.", "\u201cHow could it be? How could you be this powerful?\u201d Wei Liang roared in shock.", "His hands were fractured, and his entire arm was completely numb. He could barely hold the spear in his hand.", "His blood was also boiling with Qi blood rising up his throat, but he forced it back down.", "\u201cNothing is impossible! Those were two of my moves, and here\u2019s another one.\u201d Su Mo said coldly and immediately attacked again, leaving Wei Liang no time for recovery.", "Blast through Stray Clouds!", "Pew!", "The sword radiance glinted, and all the surrounding airflow immediately began to rumble. Suddenly, a cyclone appeared, tearing up all its surroundings and heading straight towards Wei Liang.", "\u201cHowl!\u201d Wei Liang roared as a fear of imminent death arose in him, and a seven-foot-long spear appeared on his back surrounded by yellow light.", "Wei Liang\u2019s Martial Soul with four yellow halos was also a long spear, and it meshed well with the weapons he used.", "Rank 4 Human Class Martial Soul!", "\u201cStarlight Illuminating the Earth!\u201d", "This time, Wei Liang did not simply defend himself. Instead, he used his Martial Soul and all the genuine Qi in his body to enact his strongest move to counter Su Mo\u2019s attack.", "After he released his Martial Soul, Wei Liang\u2019s power increased at least by half.", "The spear rattled and tore through the air to meet the approaching attack.", "Boom!", "The fierce attacks violently crashed into each other.", "Poof!", "A stream of blood shot into the air. Wei Liang\u2019s body flew back like a limp sack and fell to the ground.", "Silence!", "Everything surrounding them was dead silent.", "All the spectators were completely dumbfounded and could not believe their eyes. The result was way beyond their expectation.", "Su Mo had gained a crushing victory over Wei Liang!", "Wei Liang was defenseless against Su Mo!", "After a moment of silence, the entire square erupted with deafening noise.", "\u201cMy God, Wei Liang actually lost!\u201d", "\u201cIs this Su Mo\u2019s actual power?\u201d", "\u201cWhat kind of Rank 1 Human Class Martial Soul could do that? The Sus have been lying to us!\u201d", "\u201cTsk tsk, it\u2019s so impressive that he\u2019s that powerful with only an Lv 5 cultivation!\u201d", "\u201c\u2026\u201d", "The chaotic chatter went on for a long time.", "On the spectators stand even Su Hong seemed stunned. Even though he believed in his son, he was still surprised by Su Mo\u2019s strength.", "Unlike the shocked Su Hong, Xi\u2019er was smiling joyfully.", "Su Mo had a special place in her heart, and her impression of him was merging with the dashing hero she met two weeks ago.", "Back then, when Xi\u2019er was kidnapped by bandits, she had already given up her will to live. If those bandits had tried to tarnish her chastity, she would have immediately killed herself.", "However, at that moment, a handsome young man had come out of nowhere, rescued her, and avenged her.", "She vowed to follow Su Mo not only because she wanted to become stronger, but also out of her thankfulness and idolization toward him.", "In the Weis\u2019 camp, every member of the Weis was stone-faced, especially Wei Wankong, who was sulking and secretly cursing Wei Liang for being a failure.", "In a 30 meter-high tower with 300 meters from the square, a well-dressed handsome young man watched the square from afar with a sour look on his face.", "He huffed coldly and turned away.", "This young man was Lin Xiao.", "On the square, Wei Liang stood up pathetically and could not help but spit out another mouthful of blood.", "\u201cThis can\u2019t be possible!\u201d", "His eyes were filled with shock, and he could not accept his loss.", "\u201cHa! Wei Liang, didn\u2019t you want to kill me?\u201d Su Mo asked with a mocking smile.", "\u201cYou\u2026!\u201d", "Wei Liang\u2019s face contorted, and he roared with a crazed look in his eyes. \u201cI haven\u2019t lost, and you\u2019ll still die today!\u201d", "He suddenly took out a black medicinal pill from his pocket and swallowed it.", "Boom!", "After swallowing the pill, Wei Liang\u2019s body noticeably shriveled.", "At the same time, the breath in his body dramatically increased. In a matter of seconds, he reached an equivalent of Lv 7 Qi Cultivation Realm.", "\u201cIt\u2019s a Seething Blood Pill!\u201d", "\u201cMy God, Wei Liang ate a Seething Blood Pill!\u201d The crowd immediately exclaimed.", "The Seething Blood Pill was an extremely potent elixir that caused a martial artist\u2019s blood to erupt and their body to dry up in 15 minutes.", "The benefit was that during this time span, this person\u2019s strength would greatly increase.", "Of course, the cost was that the person would die of blood loss as the time passed.", "However, if the martial artist stopped the effects of the pill earlier, he could survive, but this would prevent him from pursuing martial arts in the future.", "\u201cStop it!\u201d Su Hong stood up in the spectators stand and yelled angrily at the Weis. \u201cWei Wankong, how dare your disciple to use the Seething Blood Pill in an official match! This battle is canceled.\u201d", "Wei Wankong was stunned, but then his sulking expression turned into a smile.", "He had not expected Wei Liang to take a Seething Blood Pill, either.", "However, since he had already taken it, this battle could turn in his favor.", "\u201cSu Hong! You\u2019ve never said that medicinal pills couldn\u2019t be used before the battle began.\u201d Wei Wankong chuckled and continued, \u201cWe\u2019ve agreed before that the results of this battle and their lives would be decided by fate. Are you going back on your word?\u201d", "\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Su Hong shouted angrily, \u201cThis battle is no longer fair. I object to it.\u201d", "He then yelled into the arena, \u201cMo\u2019er, this battle is over! You can come back!\u201d", "After he took the Seething Blood Pill, Wei Liang\u2019s cultivation was equivalent to Lv 7 Qi Cultivation Realm. Su Hong was not willing to watch his son be killed.", "In the arena, Su Mo heard his father\u2019s call but did not move.", "He coldly glanced at Wei Liang and said to Su Hong, \u201cFather, I don\u2019t see any issue in testing his current abilities!\u201d", "Su Mo\u2019s eyes surged with fighting desire, and his blood boiled.", "\u201cSeething Blood Pill?\u201d", "\u201cLv 7 Qi Cultivation Realm?\u201d", "\u201cWho knows who\u2019s going to win or lose!\u201d", "\u201cMo\u2019er\u2026\u201d Su Hong was extremely worried.", "\u201cFather, don\u2019t worry! I know what I\u2019m doing.\u201d", "Su Hong sighed and nodded in defeat while secretly preparing to save Su Mo if his life was in danger.", "\u201cGreat, he\u2019s indeed quite brave. Su Hong, since your son wants to keep fighting, let\u2019s continue!\u201d Wei Wankong laughed."]}}
