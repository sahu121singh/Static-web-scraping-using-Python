{"Chapter 3": {" Ninefold Ocean Wave Fist": ["Translator:\u00a0Transn\u00a0\u00a0Editor:\u00a0Transn", "The next morning,\u00a0Su Mo got up early, freshened up, and headed into the Book Collection Pavilion.", "The Book Collection Pavilion, a four-storey tower, was where the Sus stored scrolls of martial arts.", "Before Su Mo had awakened his Martial Soul, he could only study the elementary martial arts on the first floor. Now that he had awakened his Martial Soul, and his cultivation was at Lv 1 Qi Cultivation Realm, he could choose cultivation skill and martial skill suited for him.", "There were nine levels of cultivation skill and martial skill.", "Each level was divided into three grades: Lower, Medium, and Upper.", "Martial artists who used higher grade cultivation skill were naturally more powerful.", "\u201cElder, I want to choose a scroll on the second floor,\u201d Su Mo said, saluting the pavilion protector as he stepped into the Book Collection Pavilion.", "\u201cThe second floor?\u201d", "The pavilion protector, a fat old man, said indifferently, \u201cSu Mo, the second floor can only be accessed by those whose cultivation is at the Qi Cultivation Realm. No exceptions.\u201d", "\u201cI know that, elder. My cultivation is at Lv 1 Qi Cultivation Realm,\u201d Su Mo nodded and said.", "\u201cLv 1 Qi Cultivation Realm?\u201d The pavilion protector was stunned. Then, he said with a cold expression, \u201cSu Mo, you just awakened your Martial Soul yesterday, and it was at Rank 1 Human Class. How could you be at the Qi Cultivation Realm so soon with that crappy Martial Soul? Even if you had a Rank 3 Human Class Martial Soul, it wouldn\u2019t be possible. Are you kidding me?\u201d", "\u201cHumph! You\u2019ll see!\u201d", "Su Mo released an aura of Lv 1 Qi Cultivation Realm with a serious expression.", "Then, he turned around and went up to the second floor of the Book Collection Pavilion, leaving the pavilion protector behind.", "\u201cHe\u2026 he did it!\u201d", "The pavilion protector was stunned, but then he laughed disdainfully and said to himself, \u201cThe Master must have given him some precious elixir, but he still won\u2019t be able to go much further with his crappy Martial Soul.\u201d", "Su Mo went to the second floor and saw rows of antique bookshelves, which were full of scrolls.", "The Sus was one of two main clans in Sunnywood City, so they had many cultivation skills and martial skills. There were almost 100 scrolls on the second floor of the Book Collection Pavilion.", "A tall young man was browsing the scrolls there.", "\u201cSu Mo!\u201d", "The young man was initially surprised to see Su Mo, but then he glared at him with complete disdain.", "\u201cSu Heng!\u201d Su Mo glanced back at him.", "Su Heng also awakened a Martial Soul yesterday. His Martial Soul was of Rank 4 Human Class Martial Soul, which was not as good as Su Yu\u2019s, but a high rank nonetheless.", "Since Su Heng was on the second floor, his cultivation must have also reached the Qi Cultivation Realm.", "\u201cWell, this is unexpected, Su Mo. I heard yesterday that the Master bought a \u2018Qi Condensation Elixir\u2019 from the Herbs Shop, which is probably what you used to increase your cultivation!\u201d", "Su Heng looked at Sumo and said disdainfully, \u201cOtherwise, you wouldn\u2019t even be able to reach the Qi Cultivation Realm with that crappy Rank 1 Human Class Martial Soul.\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s none of your business how I got this cultivation,\u201d Su Mo said coldly. Then, he began to browse the manuals and ignored him.", "Su Mo knew Su Heng very well.", "When Su Mo was still considered the top genius of the Sus, Su Heng had fawned on him, and Su Mo had been very kind to him.", "However, Su Heng now had a completely different attitude towards Su Mo.", "\u201cHumph! So much for being a genius. You\u2019re nothing but a piece of trash!\u201d Su Heng snorted and continued selecting his manuals.", "Su Mo picked up a manual in the cultivation skill category and began reading it.", "\u201cRaging Fire Skill.\u00a0Medium Lv 1 Cultivation Skill. The Genuine Qi cultivated through this method has extremely powerful fire power and has a very strong attack\u2026\u201d", "Su Mo continued to browse after reading a few pages of this book.", "He wanted to read a few more manuals to choose the most suitable cultivation skill.", "All of the manuals on this floor were at Medium Lv 1. The manuals of Upper Lv 1 were only on the third floor.", "However, those manuals were only available for those whose cultivation was at Lv 7 Qi Cultivation Realm.", "\u201cHuge Rock Skill.\u00a0Medium Lv 1 cultivation skill. The Genuine Qi cultivated through this method is dense and has strong defense\u2026\u201d", "\u201cClouds Skill.\u00a0Medium Lv 1 cultivation skill. The Genuine Qi cultivated through this method is pure and has equally strong attack and defense\u2026\u201d", "After reading several manuals, Su Mo selected\u00a0Cloud Skill\u00a0because of its pure genuine Qi and strong attack and defense.", "After choosing a cultivation skill, it was time to choose a martial skill.", "\u201cIron Fist.\u00a0This fistplay is fierce and can easily crack open stones after practicing to the great Completion Realm\u2026 \u201d", "\u201cFlying Swordplay.\u00a0This swordsmanship is ethereal, agile, and gorgeous\u2026\u201d", "\u201cBreeze Palm\u2026\u201d", "\u201cInfinite Push Hands\u2026\u201d", "Su Mo was not satisfied with a dozen martial skills that he read.", "\u201cNinefold Ocean Wave Fist?\u201d", "Su Mo\u2019s eyes brightened when he saw the name of this manual. He could recognize that it was extraordinary.", "He opened the manual excitedly.\u00a0\u201cNinefold Ocean Wave Fist.\u00a0Medium Lv 1 Martial Skill. The body is like the sea, and the fist is like a wave. The fist force has many levels, and each level is stronger than the previous one.\u201d", "\u201cThis is the one!\u201d\u00a0After reading for a moment, Su Mo nodded with satisfaction.", "As he was about to leave with the two manuals, Su Heng suddenly blocked him.", "\u201cSu Mo, put down\u00a0Ninefold Ocean Wave Fist,\u201d\u00a0Su Heng shouted arrogantly.", "Su Mo glanced at him and asked, \u201cWhy should I?\u201d", "\u201cI was thinking about taking that manual, and I\u2019ve decided that I want it, so give it back to me!\u201d Su Heng raised his chin and ordered.", "\u201cGive it back to you? It was never yours!\u201d", "Su Mo scoffed and said, \u201cThe book is mine now, so you\u2019re not getting it.\u201d", "\u201cAre you sure?\u201d Su Heng\u2019s eyes grew cold, and he said, \u201cSu Mo, do you know what the consequences of angering me are?\u201d", "\u201cWhat consequences?\u201d Su Mo smiled and said, \u201cI have no idea. Please tell me.\u201d", "\u201cYou\u2019re a piece of trash, but you\u2019re still so arrogant.\u201d Su Heng shouted furiously, \u201cSu Mo, I\u2019ll say it again. Give it to me, kneel, and apologize, or I\u2019ll break your legs.\u201d", "\u201cKneel and apologize, or you\u2019ll break my legs?\u201d", "A cold light flashed in Su Mo\u2019s eyes, and he said indifferently, \u201cI\u2019d like to see you try!\u201d", "\u201cYou\u2019re courting death!\u201d", "Su Heng shouted, and his spirit of Lv 1 Qi Cultivation Realm exploded. A yellow light shone behind him, which meant that he was arousing his Martial Soul to attack.", "\u201cStop it!\u201d", "At that moment, the pavilion protector said with an icy voice, \u201cNo fighting in the Book Collection Pavilion, or you\u2019ll be banned for life!\u201d", "These words stopped Su Heng.", "\u201cElder, I\u2019m sorry. I won\u2019t violate the rules,\u201d Su Heng said hastily to the elder, stifling his anger.", "Even though he wanted to teach Su Mo a lesson, Su Heng did not dare to violate the rules.", "It would be a great loss if he was banned from the Book Collection Pavilion for life.", "\u201cToday is your lucky day. I won\u2019t let you off next time,\u201d Su Heng turned to Su Mo and snarled.", "\u201cIdiot!\u201d Su Mo glanced at him and turned to leave.", "\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d", "Su Heng became furious again. He glared at the leaving Su Mo and gnashed his teeth in anger.", "Since he had awakened a Rank 4 Human Class Martial Soul, his status had risen a lot in the Sus, and others were polite to him.", "Today, he was insulted by this useless man with a crappy Martial Soul, and that drove him mad.", "\u201cDamn it, I\u2019ll make you pay!\u201d"]}}
