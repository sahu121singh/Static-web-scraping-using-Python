{"Chapter 10": {" Luo Huan": ["Translator:\u00a0Transn\u00a0\u00a0Editor:\u00a0Transn", "Luo Huan", "\u201cYoung Master Su, welcome to Purple Gold Pavilion.\u201d", "Luo Huan smiled coyly, giving off an air of seduction. Even the sound of her voice held a hint of charm.", "Su Mo quickly regained his composure while secretly scolding himself for losing focus and almost being captivated by her.", "However, this woman was truly exceptional. He had rarely seen anyone like her, even in his past life.", "\u201cPlease take a seat, Young Master Su.\u201d", "Luo Huan arched her thin brow slightly and could not help but feel impressed by Su Mo.", "She was very confident about her looks. Any man who saw her was often rendered speechless or would have a lewd expression on his face.", "Meanwhile, this 14-year-old young man was only slightly stunned before regaining his composure.", "\u201cThank you, Her Excellency.\u201d", "Su Mo sat down, confused by the fact that she knew his name.", "However, Su Mo soon realized that he was now \u201cwell-known\u201d.", "\u201cHa ha! Don\u2019t be so formal. My last name is Luo, and I\u2019m a couple of years older than you, so you can call me Sister Luo,\u201d Luo Huan said with an unwavering and charismatic smile.", "Um!", "Su Mo was dumbfounded, and then immediately nodded his head.", "Luo Huan continued, \u201cI heard that Young Master Su wants to purchase 200 Class 5 Lv 1 Beast Souls, but our pavilion only has 150. Would Young Master Su be willing to have the remaining 50 replaced by Beast Souls of other levels?\u201d", "\u201cClass 4 Lv 1 Beast Souls would be fine!\u201d said Su Mo.", "He did not mind that Class 4 were less effective because he could simply take more.", "\u201cYes, Young Master!\u201d Luo Huan nodded, took out a gray pouch, and handed it to him.", "\u201cHere are 150 Class 5 Lv 1 Beast Souls, and 85 Class 4 Lv 1 Beast Souls. That\u2019ll be 500 kilograms of gold. Also, this storage pouch is a gift from me to you.\u201d", "Su Mo was shocked by her generosity.", "This storage pouch was definitely not cheap. Even the cheapest pouches cost over 35 kilograms of gold.", "\u201cHa ha! Thank you so much, Sister Luo!\u201d", "Su Mo did not object and accepted the storage pouch.", "After buying the Beast Souls, Su Mo immediately said his goodbyes and left.", "\u201cMy Lady? I heard that young master Su only has a Martial Soul of Rank 1 Human Class, why are you\u2026?\u201d asked a frowning old woman, who appeared silently in the hall.", "\u201cAunt Xu, Su Mo isn\u2019t as simple as he seems. I can feel that he has incredibly strong Qi blood, much stronger than that of other martial artists of his level.\u201d", "\u2026", "While Su Mo was out purchasing Beast Souls in Purple Gold Pavilion, there was a meeting going on in the Su meeting hall.", "\u201cFirst Elder, why have you called this meeting?\u201d", "asked Su Hong, who was seated at the head of the table and eyeing the First Elder.", "\u201cMaster, I heard from the Accounting Department that you took out 500 kilograms of gold today. What were you planning on using this money for?\u201d", "The First Elder Su Yue, a grumpy middle-aged man in his 40s, interrogated Master Su Hong as soon as the meeting began.", "As the First Elder of the Sus, Su Yue was second only to the Master in power and status.", "He was also the only person in the Sus who had the nerve to speak to Su Hong in this manner.", "\u201cThese 500 kilograms of gold were funds for Su Mo to purchase resources for his cultivation,\u201d admitted Su Hong frankly.", "\u201cWhat!?\u201d The First Elder was shocked.", "All the elders were also completely shocked!", "\u201cSu Hong, are you insane?\u201d", "The First Elder came to his senses, sprung to his feet, and roared, \u201cSu Hong, how dare you use 500 kilograms of gold to cultivate your failed son! As the Master, what right do you have to spend that much gold on your own son? The Sus doesn\u2019t consist of only your family. I won\u2019t allow it!\u201d", "\u201cThat\u2019s true. Su Mo is a failure. We shouldn\u2019t waste so much on raising him!\u201d agreed the Fourth Elder, Su Tai.", "\u201cExactly, Master. It\u2019s so selfish of you to care only about your own son!\u201d", "\u201cHow could you waste so much gold on raising your degenerate son?\u201d", "\u201c\u2026\u201d", "All the other elders spoke to echo the First Elder.", "\u201cAre you all done talking?\u201d", "Su Hong waited for everyone to quiet down and scanned the room of elders coldly. \u201cI\u2019ve already spent the 500 kilograms of gold. This issue is over. If there\u2019s nothing else to discuss, let\u2019s end this meeting!\u201d", "\u201cWhat? It\u2019s all been spent already?\u201d", "Everyone was stunned.", "The First Elder\u2019s countenance hardened.", "His son, Su Yu, had awakened a Rank 5 Human Class Martial Soul and was regarded as the first genius in the Sus, yet all his monthly cultivating expenses barely exceeded 50 kilograms of gold.", "Yet, a piece of trash like Su Mo somehow managed to use up over 500 kilograms.", "\u2026", "After successfully buying his Beast Souls, Su Mo was extremely excited and impatiently ran home.", "He was eager to see what level his Martial Soul would advance to after devouring these Beast Souls.", "\u201cIt should be enough to advance to Rank 6 Human Class!\u201d\u00a0thought Su Mo.", "\u201cHa ha! Little lady, with me, you\u2019ll feel like a goddess every day.\u201d", "\u201cGet out of my way!\u201d", "\u201cDamn, don\u2019t flatter yourself. It\u2019s an honor to be selected by me.\u201d", "Suddenly, Su Mo heard a ruckus and saw three young men ahead of him surrounding a maid in blue.", "She was extremely pretty, with a stunning face, pale skin, and willowy figure.", "The leader of the young men was about 16 or 17 years old and sickly pale, and he was staring lewdly at the maid.", "The maid was terrified but could not escape, since she was surrounded.", "\u201cHa ha! You have nowhere to run!\u201d", "The young man cackled perversely and reached out to grab her hand.", "BAM!", "Suddenly, a palm reached out and cast away his hand.", "\u201cDamn it, what nuisance has the nerve to interfere with my business?\u201d the young man yelled angrily.", "He turned around to see who it was, and immediately chortled, \u201cWow! Look who it is, the top \u2018genius\u2019 of the Sus!\u201d", "The young man heavily emphasized the word \u201cgenius\u201d with a jeering expression on his face.", "It was indeed Su Mo.", "\u201cCome here, Qingqing!\u201d", "Su Mo gestured for the maid to stand behind him.", "This maid in blue also belonged to the Sus and was called Su Qingqing. Although Su Mo was not close to her, he still knew who she was.", "He could not bear to watch the inferiors of the Sus being bullied without doing something.", "\u201cBrother Su Mo!\u201d", "As soon as Su Qingqing saw Su Mo, she hurriedly hid behind him like he was her savior.", "\u201cOnly you, Wei Lin, would be so shameless to harass women in broad daylight!\u201d chuckled Su Mo at the perverted young man.", "The young man\u2019s name was Wei Lin. He was the second son of the Master of the Weis.", "He was notorious in Sunnywood City for using his clan\u2019s power as an excuse to commit all kinds of atrocious deeds.", "Countless women had been violated by him.", "\u201cHow dare such a piece of trash like you interfere with my business. You must be tired of living!\u201d said Wei Lin in a wild and boasting tone.", "\u201cAre you calling me a piece of trash?\u201d Su Mo\u2019s expression hardened. He was instantly enraged by the title.", "\u201cThat\u2019s right. You have a Rank 1 Human Class Martial Soul. That makes you a piece of trash!\u201d scoffed Wei Lin.", "\u201cYou have two choices: One, give Su Qingqing to me, kneel and bow your head to me in repentance, and call me grandfather three times, so that I will let you go. Two, I\u2019ll shatter all your limbs, then take Su Qingqing with me.\u201d", "Wei Lin was determined to have Su Qingqing today. He had pined for her beauty for a long time, and he was not willing to give up his opportunity to have her.", "Although Su Qingqing belonged to the Su clan, she was only a common inferior, and her parents had little status in the clan. Even if Wei Lin forced himself on her, there would be few consequences.", "\u201cKneel and bow my head in repentance? Call you grandfather three times?\u201d", "Su Mo\u2019s eyes flashed with rage.\u00a0\u201cAre all members of the Wei clan the same? Both Wei Long and Wei Lin love to make people bow down to them!\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019m giving you the span of three breaths to disappear from my sight, or you\u2019ll have to deal with the consequences,\u201d said Su Mo coldly.", "He was not at all scared of these three people.", "Aside from Wei Lin, who was at Lv 4 Qi Cultivation Realm, the other two with him were both at Lv 3.", "\u201cWhat?\u201d", "Wei Lin was shocked and then scoffed, \u201cDeal with the consequences? How dare a piece of trash like you say such bold things to me!\u201d", "\u201cYou two, attack him! Don\u2019t beat him to death. Just break his limbs,\u201d ordered Wei Lin.", "\u201cHa ha, don\u2019t worry young master. Leave it to us!\u201d", "His two companions cackled and rushed toward Su Mo."]}}
