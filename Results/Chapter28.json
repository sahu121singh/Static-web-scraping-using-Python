That\u2019s why it looks like this now.\u201d Su Mo admitted truthfully.", "\u201cDevoured?\u201d", "Xi\u2019er was even more confused, for she did not understand how it could be done.", "\u201cHaha, Xi\u2019er, if you want to how, I\u2019ll show you later,\u201d Su Mo said with a smile.", "Xi\u2019er only shook her head and said, \u201cSince you don\u2019t want me to see it, then I won\u2019t. Let\u2019s go, Brother Su Mo!\u201d", "Most of the demonic beasts in the outskirts of the mountain were below Class 3 Lv 1.", "Since Xi\u2019er slowed him down, Su Mo killed every demonic beast they encountered and devoured their Beast Souls, essence, and blood.", "Xi\u2019er closed her eyes every time Su Mo killed a demonic beast, despite her curiosity.", "Although Su Mo allowed her to watch, she insisted against it.", "Because Su Mo did not want her to see, she would not do so.", "Su Mo could only shake his head helplessly at her stubbornness.", "Boom!", "He killed a Class 3 Lv 1 demonic beast again.", "Just when he was about to devour it, he suddenly sensed something and turned around.", "Swish! Swish! Swish!", "Seven or eight men in black suddenly jumped out of the woods behind them and quickly surrounded Su Mo and Xi\u2019er.", "\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d Su Mo asked with a frown, hastily pulling Xi\u2019er behind him and giving them a once-over.", "The men held steel broadswords, and their dense aura indicated that they were all masters. They surrounded Su Mo and Xi\u2019er without saying a word and obviously had bad intentions.", "\u201cSu Mo, give us the girl, and I might consider letting you live.\u201d", "The leader of this group was a tall and strong middle-aged man with a cold face and eyes full of killing desire.", "Su Mo arched his brows after hearing that.", "\u201cThey\u2019re here for Xi\u2019er, and they know my identity. It seems they came prepared,\u201d\u00a0Su Mo thought.", "\u201cWho are you?\u201d Su Mo snapped at them.", "\u201cA dying man has no business knowing.\u201d The middle-aged man sneered, and then he waved his hands and shouted, \u201cKill him!\u201d", "He was obviously unwilling to waste his time, so he gave a prompt order.", "Whoosh! Whoosh!", "The others waved their long sabers and sprang toward Su Mo.", "These people had a very powerful aura and were all at Lv 7.", "If combined, they could even rival someone at Lv 8.", "Swish!", "Su Mo quickly pulled Xi\u2019er away, and they dodged the sabers, leaving only a shadow where they had just stood.", "\u201cXi\u2019er, get on my back and hold tight!\u201d Su Mo pulled her onto his back.", "Although they were all at Lv 7 Qi Cultivation Realm, it was impossible for them to kill him.", "Su Mo was only slightly threatened by the leader, who seemed to be at the Peak Lv 8 Qi Cultivation Realm, far more powerful than the others.", "If he were fighting a master at the Peak Lv 8 Qi Cultivation Realm one-on-one, he would definitely be able to slip away easily if he could not win.", "However, protecting Xi\u2019er was his top priority.", "Xi\u2019er also understood the severity of the situation, so she obediently climbed onto Su Mo\u2019s back.", "Su Mo felt the softness and fragrance of her body, but before he could enjoy it, a long saber hit toward him.", "\u201cWhoosh!\u201d", "Su Mo used his body move to dodge to the side of a man in black.", "Clash!", "After a long sword came out of its sheath, with a flash of sword radiance, a stream of blood sprayed out.", "Killed in one move!", "Su Mo stepped back rapidly after the kill.", "\u201cWhat?\u201d", "The men in black were so astonished that he could kill someone in such a short time.", "\u201cHe\u2019s so fast!\u201d the leader said in shock.", "Just a month ago, Su Mo\u2019s strength was rarely equivalent to the Lv 7, but now, he could instantly kill a Lv 7 martial artist.", "\u201cYou\u2019re still going to hell today!\u201d the leader roared, pulling out his revolving saber and hacking toward Su Mo.", "\u201cWhoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!\u201d", "He hacked three times in a row, and three sharp gusts of sword Qi went zig-zagging toward Su Mo.", "The saber Qi blocked Su Mo from dodging, so he had to face it directly.", "\u201cGale Blade!\u201d", "Su Mo swung his sword with the power of surging winds. Soon, the sword radiance burst out and cut the saber Qi in front of him.", "Boom!", "The saber Qi was shattered and turned into a fierce wind that swept around.", "Uh!", "Suddenly, a muffled groan escaped from Xi\u2019er\u2019s lips.", "Su Mo turned back and found Xi\u2019s face was pale as white paper. She was biting her lips so hard to hold her moans back.", "Su Mo was shocked and felt guilty for not noticing.", "Xi\u2019er was so weak that she could not withstand the aftershocks of the attacks.", "However, there was no time to think. As soon as he countered this attack, more attacks came from the other men.", "The saber radiance shined like streaks of lightning, heading toward Su Mo\u2019s vital parts.", "Swirling Winds and Clouds!", "As a sword slashed, a fierce wind forced both the men and Su Mo back.", "He could have beaten those men, but he had to make sure that Xi\u2019er could avoid the aftershock of his attack.", "Before Su Mo could find his footing, the saber radiance swept toward his stomach.", "The leader had attacked him again.", "The others also attacked him fiercely and did not give Su Mo the slightest break.", "The leader struck him at his most vulnerable time, which was after Su Mo finished his last strike and before he could strike again.", "In order to protect Xi\u2019er, Su Mo had to reign in his attacks, so he could not display his full strength.", "Su Mo could no longer resisting the attack and could only try his best to dodge it.", "Puff!", "Although Su Mo managed to dodge the blade, the saber Qi still left a deep wound on him.", "His blood streamed out of the wound.", "\u201cBrother Su Mo!\u201d Xi\u2019er was horrified, and tears appeared in her eyes.", "\u201cBrother Su Mo, just put me down and forget about me. You should run!\u201d Xi\u2019er said, sobbing.", "\u201cXi\u2019er, don\u2019t be silly. They can\u2019t trap me if I don\u2019t want to stay.\u201d", "Su Mo laughed, and then he swiftly shifted his direction and dashed deeper into the woods.", "In the blink of an eye, he had run dozens of meters.", "\u201cFollow him and don\u2019t let him get away!\u201d The leader ordered and led his men after Su Mo."]}}
