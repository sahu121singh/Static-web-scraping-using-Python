There were big pits behind the village that had been dug to bury the bodies.", "After talking to the men, he found out that they were a hunting squad that had survived the slaughter because they were out hunting.", "\u201cYou saved so many of our women and killed all the bandits to avenge us. Thank you very much! Please accept my gratitude!\u201d", "The leader of the hunting squad instantly bowed to him respectfully after learning that Su Mo had saved the women.", "\u201cBrother, you\u2019re welcome. Let\u2019s first bury the deceased and help them rest in peace!\u201d", "Su Mo said and waved his hand to the leader.", "\u201cAlright!\u201d", "The leader nodded silently and continued to carry the bodies.", "\u201cHmm?\u201d", "Su Mo looked around and saw the gorgeous maiden from before kneeling down before a body and crying.", "The corpse belonged to the old, gray-haired man whom he had talked to.", "\u201cShe must be that old man\u2019s granddaughter!\u201d\u00a0Su Mo instantly realized.", "Walking over and squatting down next to her, he lightly patted her shoulder and consoled her. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry for your loss!\u201d", "However, the maiden continued sobbing, as if she had not heard him.", "\u201cAlas\u2026\u201d", "Su Mo secretly sighed and thought,\u00a0\u201cParting with the dead is the most painful thing in life!\u201d", "\u201cMaster, I\u2019m an orphan and was abandoned in the wilderness as a child. Grandpa found me and raised me.\u201d", "The maiden slowly said in a bitter tone, \u201cGrandpa treated me like his own granddaughter, always saving the best things for me and offering me a good life, but it\u2019s all my fault that he\u2019s dead.\u201d", "\u201cWhy am I not a martial artist?\u201d", "\u201cIf I\u2019d been a powerful martial artist, I would\u2019ve been able to protect grandpa and our village!\u201d", "\u201cIf I\u2019d been a powerful martial artist, grandpa and all the other villagers wouldn\u2019t have died!\u201d", "\u201c\u2026\u201d", "She kept talking, and Su Mo could not tell if she was talking to him or just murmuring to herself.", "Her body shook continuously, and big teardrops rolled down her cheeks.", "Su Mo listened to her in silence.", "\u201cSurvival of the fittest means that the strong preys on the weak, so things never end well for the weak!\u201d", "After a long time, she stopped crying.", "\u201cYou must toughen up if you don\u2019t want your grandpa to worry in heaven.\u201d Su Mo could not do anything but comfort her.", "\u201cI\u2019m so sorry to let you see me like this!\u201d she said bashfully, wiping the tears from her face.", "\u201cIt\u2019s fine. Let\u2019s first bury your grandpa and help him rest in peace,\u201d said Su Mo. They then buried the old man behind the village.", "After that, Su Mo was about to leave.", "The villagers had buried all the deceased and came here to show their gratitude to him again.", "Su Mo returned all the belongings the bandits had stolen to the villagers and was ready to leave.", "\u201cYoung master!\u201d", "Suddenly, a voice chirped behind him. Su Mo turned around and saw the maiden in green.", "\u201cI\u2026 I want to follow you. Would you be willing to take me in?\u201d", "She slowly walked toward Su Mo and was tightly gritting her teeth, as if she had made up her mind.", "She stared at Su Mo with her bright, beautiful eyes, as if she was afraid of being rejected by him.", "Su Mo was startled and did not know why she would want such a thing.", "\u201cWhy do you want to follow me?\u201d", "He, of course, did not mind having such a beautiful girl around.", "However, he still had to understand her intentions. After all, he could not foolishly take her home simply due to her attractiveness.", "\u201cI want to learn to practice martial arts with you.\u201d", "Her tender face was full of resolve, and she said, \u201cI think you\u2019re a good person. Only by following you can I be a powerful martial artist.\u201d", "\u201cYou can rest assured that I won\u2019t be a burden to you, since I can cook, wash clothes, and do chores. I\u2019m even willing to be your servant, so please take me in!\u201d", "She looked very pitiful, and her eyes widened anticipation. After she spoke, she started to kneel.", "Su Mo hurriedly pulled her up and said, \u201cSince you\u2019re willing to follow me, come, and I\u2019ll teach you cultivation.\u201d", "\u201cOf course, if you want to leave in the future, I won\u2019t stop you.\u201d", "Su Mo sighed in his heart.\u00a0\u201cThe maiden may have seemed weak, but she was strong-willed and resolute.\u201d", "\u201cThank you, Young Master!\u201d", "She gave him a rare and charming smile, which stopped his heart.", "Then, Su Mo took the maiden back to Sunnywood City.", "They did not ride horses and instead walked back.", "She had not awakened her Martial Soul to be a real martial artist, but she had reached Lv 6 Body Tempering. Thus, she could easily walk dozens of kilometers.", "On the way, Su Mo chatted a lot with her and got a general understanding of who she was.", "She was called Gu Lanxi, a very beautiful name.", "She was 14 years old this year and 15 in two months, so she was almost the same age as him.", "At dusk, they reached the Su clan.", "\u201cHoly crap! Where did Su Mo find such an appealing girl?\u201d", "\u201cThe piece of trash probably knows that he\u2019ll die soon, so he wants to enjoy his last two weeks.\u201d", "\u201cYou may be right! Damn it, why all beauties are wasted on losers!\u201d", "When Su Mo brought Gu Lanxi into the mansion of the Sus, many people were instantly drawn to her looks.", "Many disciples spoke sourly out of admiration, jealousy, and in most cases, contempt.", "Su Mo led her into his yard and arranged a room for her.", "His yard had four rooms. One was for himself, and the other three were empty.", "\u201cXi\u2019er, this is where you\u2019ll stay.\u201d", "Su Mo helped her clean up the room and gave her some daily essentials. \u201cIf you need anything later, just let me know.\u201d", "\u201cThanks a lot!\u201d She lightly nodded.", "\u201cAs for cultivating, I\u2019ll buy you some elixirs to help you accomplish your Body Tempering as soon as possible.\u201d", "He added, \u201cWhen you finish your Body Tempering, I\u2019ll find a way to help you awaken your Martial Soul.\u201d", "\u201cAlright. Sorry to bother you!\u201d", "The maiden felt somehow touched and greatly respected him.", "\u201cHaha! Xi\u2019er, you don\u2019t need to be so polite. I\u2019m very casual.\u201d", "Su Mo lightly smiled and said, \u201cDon\u2019t call me \u2018young master\u2019 anymore, it sounds very awkward. You can just call me by my name.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2026 I can\u2019t do that!\u201d", "She hastily waved her hands and anxiously said, \u201cYou did me a great favor, so how can I directly call you by your name? That is quite disrespectful. Besides, I\u2019m only your maid, and I wouldn\u2019t dare to call you that.\u201d", "Er!", "Su Mo was instantly speechless and thought,\u00a0\u201cShe\u2019s too uptight!\u201d", "\u201cWho says you\u2019re my maid? From now on, you\u2019re my little sister,\u201d Su Mo said seriously.", "Hearing this, she suddenly widened her bright eyes and stared at him intently.", "\u201cSo you don\u2019t want to be my little sister?\u201d Su Mo deliberately pretended to be angry and asked her.", "\u201cNo\u2026 No, I want to!\u201d", "Her face was blushing, and his words touched her heart.", "\u201cHaha! Come on, call me brother,\u201d Su Mo smiled and said teasingly.", "\u201cEr\u2026 Brother Su Mo!\u201d she said very quietly with her head down, her face blushing with shame.", "\u201cHaha\u2026\u201d Su Mo burst into laughter."]}}
